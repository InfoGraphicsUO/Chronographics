,,Abbot (George),Watkins,"An English prelate, was born in 1562, at Guilford, in Surry, where his father was a weaver. He was educated at the grammar school of that place, from whence he was removed to Balliol college, Oxford, of which he became a fellow. In 1597, he was chosen master of University college. In 1599, he was made dean of Winchester, and the year following vicechancellor of Oxford, which office he filled in 1603, and also in 1605. He was One of the divines employed in the present translation of the Bible. In 1609, he was made bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, from whence, the same year, he was translated to London, and in 1610, to Canterbury. He had the courage to oppose the court on some occasions, particularly in the affair of the divorce of the lady Essex, and the Book of Sports, which he forbade being read at Crovdon. A sad misfortune happened to him at the close of his life: for being at the seat of lord Zouch, and exercising himself in the park with a cross bow, he by accident shot the keeper instead of the deer. A commission was appointed to examine whether by this irregularity he was incapacitated for discharging the office of primate; and the determination being left with the king, he gave it in favour of the archbishop. He ever after kept a monthly fast on account of the misfortune, and settled 20l. a year on the widow of the keeper. He attended king James on his death-bed, and assisted at the coronation of Charles I. In 1627, an assize sermon of Dr. Sibthorpe, preached at Northampton, was sent to the archbishop, with an order from the king to license it; which he refused to do, as it contained exceptionable passages. For this he was banished to his house near Canterbury, and the archlepiscopal authority was put into commission; but when the parliament met, he was restored to his office, but never fully recovered the royal favour. He died at Croydon in 1633, and was buried in the church of the Holy Trinity at Guilford, where he endowed an hospital. The archbishop was a rigid Calvinist and a great favourer of the Puritans. His writings are mostly polemical, except a geographical description of the world.",,,,1633.0,d.,40.0,D,d.

,,Abelard (Peter),Watkins,"Was born in 1079, at Palais, near Nantz, in Britany. He studied logic and metaphysics with such eagerness that he soon became a powerful disputant; and turning his talents against his old master Champeaux, professor of philosophy at Paris, obliged him to quit his chair and retire to a convent. Abelard then applied to the study of divinity, and in a short time became celebrated in that faculty. A wealthy canon, called Fulbert, took Abelard into his house on condition that he should teach his niece Heloise philosophy. Instead, however, of abstruse learning, he taught her love, and Abelard was so intoxicated with the passion that his lectures lost the charms, which used to attract the admiration of crowded audiences, and every body saw the reason of it except Fulbert, who at last, being convinced of the truth, turned Abelard out of doors. Heloise, on this, followed her lover, who conveyed her to his sister's house in Britany, where she was delivered of a son, named Astrolabius; and Abelard offered Fulbert to marry his niece, but it is astonishing, that though the uncle was pleased with the oiler, the lady refused it. She afterwards, indeed, consented to a private marriage, but never would own it, and indeed sometimes would not scruple to swear that it was not true. This added greater fury to the canon's rage; and Abelard sent her, in consequence, to the monastery of Argenteuil where she put on the religions habit, but not the veil. The enraged Fulbert caused Abelard to be emasculated by ruffians, who broke into his chamber; on which he turned monk in the abbey of St. Denis, which he soon left, and retired to Champaigns, where he became lecturer, and with great success. This raised him numerous enemies, particularly the professors at Rheims, who charged him with heterodoxy on the subject of the Trinity, and got him censured at the council of Soissons, in 1121. He afterwards erected an oratory in the diocese of Troyes, called the Paraclete, but was soon driven from it by his enemies. He next became abbot of Ruis, in the diocese of Vannes, and gave Heloise and some other nuns the Paraclete. In 1140, his works were condemned as heretical by a council; which decree was confirmed by the pope, who ordered Abelard to be confined; but at the request of Peter, abbot of Clugny, this sentence was mitigated. After a life of extraordinary vicissitudes, Abelard died in the priory of St. Marcellas, in 1142, and the corpse being sent to Heloise she deposited it in the Paraclete. The names of these lovers are eternized by the epistles published by Pope and other poets. Heloise died in 1103, and was buried in the Paraclete; and in 1780, the abbess, madame de Roncy, ordered the bones of the lovers to be placed in a leaden coffin and deposited under the altar. She also caused a monument of black marble to be placed over the spot. The works of Abelard were published at Paris in one volume, 4to. 1616.",,,,1143.0,d.,40.0,D,d.

,,Addison (Joseph),Watkins,"Son of the above, was born at Milston, in Wilts, May 1, 1675. After recieving the rudiments of education, he was sent to the Charter-house, where he contracted an intimacy with sir Richard Steele. In 1687, lie was admitted of Queen's college, Oxford, but afterwards was elected demy at Magdalen. In 1693, he took his degree of M. A. and became eminent for his Latin poetry. At the age of 22, he addressed some verses to Dryden in English, and not long after published a translation of part of Virgil's fourth Georgic. About this time he wrote the arguments prefixed to the several books of Dryden's Virgil, and composed the essay on the Georgies. In 1695, he addressed a poem to king William which recommended him to lord Somers. In 1699, he obtained a pension of 300/. a year, to enable him to travel. He went through France and Italy, improving his mind to the best advantage, as appears from his ""Letter to Lord Halifax,"" reckoned the most elegant of his poetical works, and his ""Travels in Italy,"" which he dedicated at his return to lord Somers. He returned home in 1702, and found his old friends out of place. In 1704, he was introduced by lord Halifax to lord Godolphin as a fit person to celebrate the victory of Blenheim; on which occasion he produced the Campaign, for which he was rewarded with the place of commissioner of appeals. Next year he went to Hanover with lord Halifax, and soon after was appointed under-secretary of state. The rage for Italian operas which then prevailed, induced him to write his ""Rosamond,"" which did not succeed, probably because it was English. When the marquis of Wharton went to Ireland as lord lieutenant, Addison accompanied him as secretarv, and was made keeper of the records there, with a salary of 300/. a year. While he was in Ireland, Steele commenced the Tatler, to which Addison liberally contributed. This was followed by the Spectator, which was enriched by the contributions of Addison, whose papers are distinguished by one of the letters of tire word CLIO. In 1713, his tragedy of Cato was brought upon the stage, amidst the plaudits of both whigs and tories. Cato was praised by most of the contemporary poets, criticised by Dennis, attacked as a party play at Oxford, and vindicated by Dr. Sewel. It was translated into Italian, and performed at Florence, and into Latin at the college of St. Omers. At this time the Guardian appeared, to which Addison contributed, and his papers are marked by a hand. But the violence of politics soon put a stop to this paper, and Addison engaged in the party warfare, but his political pieces sunk into neglect. An attempt was made to revive the Spectator, but after the publication of eighty numbers, which compose the eighth volume, the work was relinquished. Addison's quota amounts to about a fourth part. In 1715, he began the Freeholder, and continued it till the middle of the next year, in defence of the government. In 1716, he married the countess dowager of Warwick, after a long courtship. He had been tutor to her son, but the marriage did not prove happy. In 1717, he became secretary of state, which place he soon resigned, on a pension of 1500/. a year. In his retirement he planned a tragedy on the death of Socrates, which he abandoned for a work of a more exalted kind, ""A Defence of the Christian Religion,"" part of which appeared after his death, and makes us regret that he did not live to perfect it. He also laid the plan of an English dictionary in the manner since so happily executed by Dr. Johnson. In 1719, he engaged in a political dispute with Steele, on the peerage-bill, then brought in to restrain the king from creating any new peers except in case of the extinction of an old family. Steele's pamphlet was entitled ""The Plebeian,"" and was calculated to alarm the people on the occasion; and Addison replied to it in another called ""The Old Whig,"" in which he contemptuously styled his opponent ""little Dicky."" That year terminated his life, and he ended it in a manner suitable to his character. He sent for lord Warwick, and affectionately pressing his hand, softly said, ""See in what peace a Christian can die!"" After giving directions to Mr. Tickel respecting the publication of his works, which he himself dedicated on his death-bed to Mr. Craggs, he breathed his last, June 17, 1719, at Holland-house, leaving only one daughter, -who died unmarried, in 1797. Dr. Johnson, after drawing his character in a forcible and elegant manner, says, ""whoever wishes to attain an English style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious, must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.""",,,,1719.0,d.,41.0,P,d.

He married Sabina, the heiress of Trajan, whom he accompanied in his expeditions, and became successively praetor, governor of Pannonia, and consul. On the death of Trajan, in 117, he assumed the government, made peace with the Persians, and remitted the debts of the Roman people. No monarch travelled more than Adrian. In 120, he visited Gaul, from whence he went to Britain, where he built a wall, from the mouth of the Tyne to Sol-way-frith, eighty miles in length, to secure the Roman province from the incursions of the Caledonians. On leaving Britain, he went into Africa and Asia, and was initiated, into the Eleusinian mysteries at Athens, in 125. In his reign the Christians suffered a dreadful persecution. He built a temple to Jupiter on mount Calvary, and placed a statue of Adonis in the manger of Bethlem; he also had the images of swine engraved on the gates of Jerusalem. He died at Baiae in the 63d year of his age, having reigned twenty-one years. On his death-bed he composed, some Latin verses, addressed to his soul which betray his uncertainty with regard to a future state. He had great virtues, which were, however, blended with as, great vices. He adopted Titus Antoninus, on condition that he should adopt Marcus Annius Verus, and the son of Lucius Verus.",,,,138.0,d.,41.0,,d.

Being refused the habit in that house, he went to France, and became a clerk in the monastery of St. Rufus, in Provence, of which he was afterward chosen abbot. Eugenius III. made him a cardinal in 1146, and in 1148 sent him legate to Denmark and Norway, which nations he converted to the Christian faith. In 1151, he was chosen pope, on which, Henry II. king of England, sent the abbot of St. Albans, with three bishops, to congratulate him. The pope, disregarding the slight formerly put upon him, granted considerable privileges to the monastery of St. Albans, and a bull to Henry for the conquest of Ireland. In 1155, he excommunicated the king of Sicily; and about the same time, the emperor Frederic, meeting the pope near Sutinam, held his stirrup while he mounted on horseback; after which his holiness conducted him to Rome, and consecrated him king of the Romans in St. Peter's church. The next year, the king of Sicily submitted and was absolved. Adrian, by his active conduct, left the papal territory in a better state than he found it in; and died, not without suspicion of poison, in 1159.

This behaviour of his countrymen, added to the resentment which he felt on the preference shewn to the pieces of Sophocles, induced him to retire to Sicily. It is said that he died of a fracture in his skull, occasioned by an eagle letting fall a tortoise from a great height on his head; this was in the 69th year of his age. The Sicilians interred him magnificently near the river Gela. Aeschylus wrote many plays, of which only seven are extant. He has a noble boldness of expression and a lofty imagination, but is frequently bombastic, and so obscure as to be hardly understood. The best edition is that of Stanley, printed first at London in 1663, folio, and since by Paaw, at the Hague, 2 tom. 4to. 1745.

,,"Aesop, the Fabulist",Watkins,"The fabulist, was a Phrygian by birth, and lived in the time of Solon about 600 years B. C. The life of him by Planudes, an eastern monk, is confessedly fabulous, and indeed his whole history is extremely obscure, not excepting the account of him by Plutarch. All that seems worthy of credit in the different writers who have treated of him is, that he was first bought as a slave by an Athenian, from whom he learned the Greek language, and then passed successively into the service of Xanthus and Idmon, both of the isle of Samos. The latter gave him his freedom, on which he was retained by Croesus. He is said to have been put to death by the Delphians, for some remarks he passed on their licentiousness. Great respect was paid to his memory, and his fables have been universally held in esteem; but it must be confessed that a great part of the fables which pass under his name have an eastern origin; and indeed there are so many striking coincidences between what isrelated of Aesop, and of Lokman, as to induce a strong suspicion that they were one and the same person.

Being jealous of the power of Boniface, governor of Africa, he secretly advised his recal, and at the same time counselled him not to obey the mandate. This occasioned a revolt, which produced an irruption of the Vandals into that province. The treachery of Aetius being discovered, a war ensued between him and Boniface, in which the latter was slain. Aetius retired among the Huns, and returning with a large army, so alarmed Placidia, mother of Valentinian, that she put herself into his power.

On account of the comparative extent and power of his dominions, he was chosen supreme commander of the confederate army destined against Troy, which expedition commenced, according to the Usherian chronology, 1194 years B.C.. On arriving with the fleet at Aulis, the winds for a long time proved contrary; when, in conformity to the cruel superstition of such an age, the soothsayer Calchas enjoined the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia, as a propitiatory offering to Diana. His compliance with the barbarous order is said to have been the cause of the fatal hatred of his wife Clytaemnestni towards him. During the long war with Troy he fulfilled the duties of a prince and general, though his unjust treatment of Achilles, in taking from him Briseïs, was the cause of many evils to the Greeks. On his return, bringing with him Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, as a concubine, he was received with a treacherous welcome by Clytaemnestra, who had formed a guilty connection with Egisthus, and was assassinated by that prince, his relation, his own wife assisting in the deed, and triumphing in her vengeance.

His parents being dissenters intended him for the ministry in that lipe, and at the age of eighteen he was sent to Edinburgh; but instead of divinity he studied physic. In 1741, he went to Leyden, where in 1744 he took his degree of M. D. The same year appeared his ""Pleasures of Imagination,"" a poem. In this piece he offended Warburton, by asserting in a note, Shaftesbury's notion, that ridicule is the test of truth. Warburton attacked him in a preface, and Akenside was defended by his friend Dyson, in an ""Epistle to the Rev. Mr. Warburton."" In the next edition Dr. Akenside left out the obnoxious note, As a physician he began to practise at Northampton, but meeting with little success, he removed to Hampstead, and Mr. Dyson generously allowed him 300/, a year till he could fix himself in practice. Having obtained his doctor's degree at Cambridge, he was elected fellow of the college of physicians, one of the physicians of St. Thomas's hospital, and physician to the queen.

,,"Alcibiades, Son of Clinias",Watkins,"The son of Clinias, an Athenian captain, was the disciple of Socrates, who took great pains to form his mind to the love of virtue, and accompanied him or, some of his military expeditions. The distinguished rank of his family gave him considerable advantages, and the vivacity of his temper rendered him acceptable in all companies. This led him into extravagances, and a love of pleasure prevailed over the charms of philosophy, though he never totally forgot the lessons of his tutor. He early entered on a military life, and gained several prizes at the Olympic games. In the Peloponnesian war, he was appointed to command with Lysimachus under Nicias, in an expedition against Syracuse; but while he was thus employed, a charge was preferred against him at home of impiety. One morning all the Hermae, or half-statues of Mercury, which abounded at Athens, were found defaced, and on a reward being offered for the discovery of the offenders, some slaves gave information that it was done by Alcibiades and his drunken companions. For this he was ordered home; but, fearful of the consequences, he withdrew to Sparta, and stirred up the Lacedemonians to declare war against Athens. He afterwards went over to the king of Persia, by whose interest he obtained his pardon and recal. He then commanded with success against the Lacedemonians, whom he compelled to sue for peace, and was received at Athens in triumph. But his popularity did not last long : for the defeat of the Athenian fleet by Lysander, the Spartan commander, being attributed to Aicibiades, he was deprived of his command. On this he retired into Thrace, and afterwards placed himself under the protection of Pharnabazus, the Persian governor of Phrygia; but the tyrants of Athens, dreading his spirit and talents, prevailed on Pharnabazus to murder him. Accordingly, the cottage in which he resided was set fire to in the night, and in his attempt to escape he was slain, in the 46th year of his age, B. C. 404. It is related of him, that while a young man he entered a school, and asked the schoolmaster for Homer's Iliad, and finding that he had it not, he gave him a box on the ear, saying, that the man who had not Homer was not a proper person to instruct youth.",,,,-404.0,d.,43.0,,d.

,,"Aldrovandi, Ulysess",Aikin,"a celebrated naturalist, called the modern Pliny, was born at Bologna, in 1522, of a family descended from the counts of the same name. He very early displayed his inclination for travelling, by accompanying on foot, as far as the shrine of St. James of Compostella, a pilgrim whom he accidentally met with not far from home. He pursued his studies partly at Bologna and partly at Padua, and there was no science which his inquisitive disposition did not lead him to cultivate. Falling into some suspicion respecting his religious opinions, he made a journey to Rome in 1550 in order to clear himself; and there attentively studied the antiquities of the place, and drew up a treatise on the ancient statues, which he gave to his friend Lucio Mauro, with whose work on Roman antiquities it was printed. He there likewise made an acquaintance with Rondelezio, whose researches into the history of fishes gave him a taste for the knowledge of nature. Returning to Bologna he applied himself to botany, and went to Pisa to obtain further instructions in it from Ghini, the professor in that branch. He graduated in physic at Bologna in 1553, and on the following year was appointed to the chairs of logic and philosophy, and to the extraordinary lectureship of botany, which in 1561 was made ordinary. By his interest the botanical garden of Bologna was founded in 1567, of which he had the superintendence. Besides attending to the duties of his station, he employed infinite labour in accumulating all the information concerning natural history that the age could afford, collecting books of all kinds, making numerous journeys, and establishing correspondences with the learned all over Europe. He likewise, at great expense, formed a museum of rare and curious productions, and kept several of the best artists in his employ for several years in delineating them. The fruit of these toils was a prodigious collection of matter relative to all the kingdoms of nature, of which in his life-time he published four folio volumes, with plates; three of them on ornithology, and one on insects. One volume on bloodless animals, and one on fishes, were likewise composed by him. The rest published under his name, which make the whole number thirteen volumes, and treat on serpents, quadrupeds, monsters, metals, and trees, are compilations by other persons chiefly from materials which he left behind him. Notwithstanding he was aided by several princes, and by the senate of Bologna, in these expensive pursuits, he lived to exhaust all his property, and is said to have died, at the age of eighty-three, blind, and in an alms-house. He bequeathed to his country all his vast collections; of which a catalogue was printed in Italian in 1648. His museum formed the basis of that now existing at Bologna, and many of his specimens are still in being. His memory is held in great honour at his native place. His works are defective in method and selection, and abound in superfluities and matter of dubious authority; yet natural history owes him great obligations for his indefatigable industry and munificent patronage. The illustrious Buffon calls him the most laborious and learned of all the naturalists, and praises the plan and distribution of his work, and the exactness of his descriptions. Besides his manuscripts in natural history, he left copious writings upon almost every branch of the arts and sciences; which proves his disposition, like that of Pliny, to have rather been towards collection and compilation, than towards the exercise of the judgment.",,,,1605.0,d.,43.0,Ph,d.,,,73,Aldrovandus,Aldrovandus,4.0,Mathematicians &cc Physicians,Italy,69.0,male,121.0,D,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulisse_Aldrovandi,1560.0,1605.0,case2
,,Alexander the Great,Watkins,"Was the son of Philip, king of Macedon, and born at Pella, B. C. 355, the same year in which the famed temple of Diana at Ephesus was destroyed, a circumstance which was considered afterwards as ominous of his character. He had great advantages in his education, being placed first under Lysimachus, and afterwards under Aristotle, who appears to have taken uncommon pains with so illustrious a pupil. When young he discovered numerous evidences of his restless and ambitious spirit. Being told that Philip had gained a great Victory, he seemed dissatisfied, and said, that if ""his father went on at that rate, he would leave, him nothing to achieve."" At another time when his father expressed his surprize that he did not engage in the Olympic games, he replied, ""Give me kings to encounter, and I will enter immediately."" At a very early age, he succeeded in breaking-in his famous horse Bucephalus, which no one else had been able to manage. When Philip had repudiated Olympias the mother of Alexander, and taken another wife, he gave a public entertainment, during which one of the courtiers, to please the king, observed, that the gods should be supplicated to grant him a lawful heir. Alexander, fired at this, threw a goblet it his head, and exclaimed, ""Do you dare call me a bastard?"" Philip in a rage instantly drew his sword and rushed towards Alexander, but being in liquor, fell on the floor; on which the youth sarcastically said, ""See what a general you have got, who cannot take a step without falling!"" The king was then about to march against Persia, but was assassinated soon after, on which Alexander ascended the throne, and though some of the Grecian states endeavoured to shake off the Macedonian yoke, the young king soon quelled the design, and was acknowledged general of Greece. He then marched into Thrace, and gained several conquests. During his absence, Thebes revolted, on the intelligence of which Alexander returned into Greece, took that city by storm, and made a dreadful carnage of the inhabitants. He also destroyed all the buildings except the residence of Pindar the poet. This severe example had its effect on the other states, and even Athens, which was the most impatient under the domination of Macedon, distinguished itself by a servile submission to the conqueror. He next turned his arms against Darius Codomannus king of Persia, and in his 22d year crossed the Hellespont, with an army of about 40,000 men. With this force he defeated the Persians at the Granicus, with a prodigious slaughter, after which he made himself master of numerous places. At Gordium, where he assembled his army, he is said to have cut the famous knot on which the fate of Asia was said to depend. While he was in Cilicia he fell into a dangerous fever, owing to his imprudently bathing in the river Cydnus when very hot. In this state he received a letter from Parmenio, intimating his suspicions that his physician Philip had been bribed to poison him. When Philip attended with a strong medicine, Alexander took it, and giving him the letter to read, drank off the potion. On his recovery from this illness, he liberally rewarded the physician for his skill and integrity. Shortly after this he defeated Darius near Issus, took a quantity- of treasure and a number of prisoners, among whom where the mother, wife, and children of the king of Persia, who fled, This generous conduct of Alexander to these princesses forms the most brilliant action of his life. This victory was followed by the conquest of Phoenicia, Damascus, and other places. The siege of Tyre, however, took him seven months, and in revenge he committed horrible cruelties on the inhabitants. He next marched to Jerusalem, where he was met by the high-priest dressed in his sacerdotal vestments. On seeing this venerable personage, the hero bowed to the ground with such reverence as excited the astonishment or Parmenio who attended him; when Alexander informed him, that a person of this description had appeared to him in a dream in Macedonia, and promised him success in his expedition. The high-priest then presented to the monarch the prophecy of Daniel, in which it was foretold that a Grecian prince should destroy the Persian empire: in consequence of this, Alexander bestowed liberal presents on the Jews, and passed into Egypt, which country he subdued. While there he founded the city of Alexandria, and consulted the oracle of Jupiter Ammon, the priest of which flattered his vanity by asserting- that he was the son of that deity. Darius having collected a considerable army, resolved to make another struggle for his dominions; but was defeated at Arbela, and the fate of Asia was decided. This battle was followed by the taking of Susa and Persepolis. The last city Alexander caused to be burnt, at the instigation of the harlot Thais. While pursuing Darius he received intelligence of his having been slain by Bessus, whom he ordered to be put to death. Every new conquest only served to increase his ambition; and being told there were other worlds besides this, he is said to have wept, because he could not be master of them. At length he crossed the river Indus, on the banks of which he was opposed by Porus, an Indian prince, with a numerous army, in which were several elephants. The wonted fortune of the Macedonians prevailed, but Alexander was so pleased with the gallantry of Porus, that he restored him his kingdom, and entered into an alliance with him. After ranging India he returned to Babylon, which city he intended greatly to improve, when he was taken off by a fever in the 33d year of his age, B. C. 323. He had four wives: Barsina the daughter of Artabazes; Roxana, a Persian princess, by whom he left a son of his own name, who was assassinated with his mother by Cassander; Parisatis, daughter of Artaxerxes Ochus; and Statira daughter of Darius Codomannus. By his own direction his body was carried to Alexandria, where Ptolemy Lagus deposited it in a gold coffin, which one of his successors changed for a glass one. Having appointed no successor, his generals divided his conquests among themselves. The character of Alexander was made up of very great and very bad qualities. He committed many odious cruelties; and he drank to a shameful excess. In one of his drunken fits he stabbed his most intimate friend Clytus with his own hand. Yet he often performed deeds that indicated a benevolent mind; and though he was pleased with the fulsome ascription of divinity, on Other occasions he expressed his abhorrence of adulation and flattery. He had a taste for learning and the fine arts, and had always about him men of science, philosophers, and poets.",,,,-323.0,d.,43.0,,d.

,,Alexander Severus,Watkins,"A Roman emperor, was a Phoenician. His father, Genesius Marcianus, had been consul, and his mother was related to the emperor Heliogabalus; but though her family were notoriously vicious, she was distinguished by the purity of her manners, and is supposed to have been favourable to Christianity. From such a parent he could not but derive good instructions, which enabled him to resist the temptations held out in the odious court of his relations. His virtue excited the hatred of Heliogabalus, who attempted his life; which so enraged the Praetorian guards, that they put the emperor to death, and raised Alexander to the throne in the 17th year of his age. Not long afterwards he was engaged in a war with the Persians, over whom he gained a great victory in person, and on his return to Rome was honoured with a triumph. He next marched against the Germans, who had made an incursion into Gaul, but while there a sedition broke out in his army, at the head of which was a Thracian named Maximin.

,,"Alfred, or Alfred the Great",Watkins,"The youngest son of Ethelwolf, king of the West Saxons, was born at Wantage, in Berkshire, in 849. At the age of five years he was sent to Rome, and the pope anointed him with the royal unction. Ethelwolf died in 858, leaving his dominions to Ethelbald and Ethelbert, and his personal estate to his younger sons, Ethelred and Alfred, Ethelbald did not long survive his father, and was succeeded by Ethelbert; but he dying in 866, left the throne to Ethelred, who made Alfred his prime-minister and general of his armies. Ethelred dying in 871, Alfred found himself, at the age of 22, in possession of a distracted kingdom. After several actions with the Danes, his followers were so dispirited, that he found himself unable to make head against the invaders, wherefore laying aside the ensigns of royalty, he concealed himself in the cottage of one of his herdsmen. One day as he sat by the fire trimming his bow and arrows, his hostess left in his care some cakes, which were placed on the earth to be baked. Alfred, however, was so intent upon his employment as to suffer the cakes to be burned; and when the woman returned she scolded him heartily, saying, ""he could eat the cakes fast enough, though he would not take the trouble of looking after them."" He afterwards retired to the Isle of Athelney, in Somersetshire, with a few followers, and there received information that Odun, earl of Devon, had obtained a great victorv over the Danes, in Devonshire, and had taken their magical standard. On this, Alfred is said to have disguised himself as a harper, and entered the Danish camp, where his skill was so much admired that he remained a considerable time, and was admitted to play before the chiefs. Having gained a knowledge of the state of the enemy, he directed his nobles to collect their vassals, and to meet him at Selwood, in Wiltshire, which was done so secretly, that the Danes were surprised at Eddington, and completely defeated. Alfred behaved with great liberality on this ocasion, giving up the kingdom of the East Angles to those of the Danes who embraced the Christian religion. Having some respite, he put his kingdom into a state of defence, and increased his navy; and having recovered London from the Danes, he soon brought it into a flourishing state. After a rest of some years, an immense number of Danish forces landed in Kent; on which those who were settled in Northumberland broke their treaty, and fitting out two fleets sailed round the coast, and committed great ravages. They were, however, soon defeated by Alfred, who caused several of the pirates to be executed at Winchester as an example. Thus he secured the peace of his dominions, and struck terror into his enemies, after fifty-six battles by land and sea, in all of which he was personally engaged. But what makes him most an object of admiration, is his character as a reformer of laws and manners, and the promoter of learning. He composed a body of statutes, instituted the trial by jury, and divided the kingdom into shires and tithings. He was so exact in his government that robbery was unheard of, and valuable goods might be left on the high-road without danger of being meddled with. He also formed a parliament, which met in London twice a year. The state of learning in his time was so low in England, that from the Thames to the Humber hardly a man could be found who understood Latin. To remedy this evil, he invited learned men from all parts, and endowed schools throughout his kingdom; and if he was not the founder of the university of Oxford, certain it is he raised it to a reputation which it never enjoyed before; and among other acts of munificence to that eminent seat of learning, he founded University-college. He was himself a learned prince, and composed several works, and translated others from the Latin, particularly Boetius's Consolations of Philosophy. He divided the twenty-four hours into three equal parts, one devoted to the service of God, another to public affairs, and the third to refreshment. To Alfred, also, England is indebted for the foundation of her naval establishment, and he was the first who sent out ships to make the discovery of a north-east passage. In private life he was benevolent, pious, cheerful, and affable; and his person was amiable, dignified, and engaging. He died in 901, aged fiftythree. By his queen Elswitha, Afred had two sons and three daughters. He was succeeded by Edward his second son, commonly called Edward the Elder.",,,,900.0,d.,44.0,,d.

,,"Alva (Ferdinand Alvarez, duke of)",Watkins,"Was descended from one of the most ancient families in Spain, and born in 1508. He made his first campaign at the age of 17, and was present at the battle of Pavia. He was in great favour with Charles V. who made him a general, but though he distinguished himself by high military talents, he was equally noted for the cruelty of his disposition. At the siege of Metz he performed prodigies of valour; but the place was so well defended that the emperor was obliged to raise the siege. In the campaign against the pope, Alva was completely successful, and obliged the pontiff to sue for peace, after which he repaired to Rome, fell on his knees before his holiness, kissed his feet, and solicited his forgiveness. Thus it appears that superstition was as prominent a part of his character as cruelty. Philip II. sent him into the Low-countries in 1567 to reduce them to the Spanish yoke, from which they were about to revolt. Here he established a council called the bloody tribunal. He filled the United Provinces with terror and scenes of carnage, for which his memory is held in detestation to this day. After obtaining great advantages over the malcontents, the tide of success turned in their favour so rapidly, that Alva quitted the government. He was afterwards employed against Portugal, where he greatly added to his military renown, by driving don Antonio from the throne in 1581. He died the next year, aged 74.",,,,1582.0,d.,44.0,,d.

,,Ambrose (St.),Watkins,"Archbishop of Milan, was born about 340. His father was prefect of Gaul, and gave his son an excellent education. His eloquence as a pleader procured for him the governorship of Liguria and Aemilia. On the death of Auxentius, archbishop of Milan, in 374, a contest arose between the arians and catholics about electing a successor. The tumult in the church was so great that Ambrose found it necessary to go thither to restore peace. His harangue to the people was so majestic and affecting, that a voice from the multitude exclaimed, ""Let Ambrose be bishop."" This operated so powerfully upon the people that all his endeavours to resist the appointment proved ineffectual, and he was consecrated bishop. In 338 he was sent by the emperor Valentinian to the tyrant Maximus, and prevailed upon him not to enter Italy. About the same time, the heathens endeavouring to restore their religion, employed Symmachus, prefect of Rome, to plead their cause, in which he was baffled by Ambrose, who also experienced some trouble from the Arians. The empress Justina was of that sect, and demanded of him the Portian church at Milan for the Arians, which he refused. He was sent again to Maximus; but notwithstanding his eloquence the tyrant entered Italy, and made himself master of the western empire. and entered Milan in triumph. Valentinian sought refuge with Theodosius, who defeated Maximus, and restored the fugitive monarch to his throne. . While Theodosius was in Italy an insurrection happened in Thessalonica, in which the emperor's lieutenant was slain. Theodosius in revenge put to death a vast number of persons in cool blood. Soon after this massacre he came to Milan, and was about to enter the great church, when he was met at the door by Ambrose, who refused him admittance as a homicide; and it was not till a ayear afterwards, and his shewing tokens of repentance, that the prelate would admit him to christian communion. Ambrose died at Milan in 397, and was buried in the great church of that city. The best edition of his works is that of Paris, in 2 vols. folio, 1691.

,,Buonarrotti or Buonarota (Michael Angelo),Watkins,"A man of various and wonderful talents, whose genius in the fine arts places him on a line, with Homer, Milton, and Shakspeare, was descended of a noble but reduced family in Tuscany, and born in 1474. He early shewed an inclination to painting, which his friends discountenanced as degrading the dignity of their house. However he studied with ardour, and copied some of the designs, of Ghirlandajo with great exactness. He next turned his attention to sculpture, and at the age of 15 executed the head of a fawn, which still exists, and may vie with the best pieces of antiquity. This introduced him to that munificent patron of the arts Lorenzo de Medici, who took him to reside in his palace, and admitted him to his friendship. Here he executed a fine bas-relief on the subject of the battle of the centaurs. On the death of his patron he returned to his father, but resided some time in the convent of Santo Spirito, where he studied anatomy. Being invited to Rome he distinguished himself by some beautiful works of sculpture. Julius II. employed him to make his monument, and a bronze statue in the act of distributing alms. On the death of that pontiff the latter was thrown down by the populace, and converted by the duke of Ferrarainto a cannon called the Julian. The same pope set him to paint the dome of a chapel, by which he gained new reputation. Leo X. employed him in architectural works, in which he shewed the same elegance of taste as in his other pursuits. He was afterwards engaged in fortifying Florence: and when the place was taken he repaired to Venice, where he gave a design for the Rialto. On the death of the architect employed in building St. Peter's at Rome, the charge of conducting that magnificent work was entrusted to Michael Angelo, who devoted seventeen years to it without salaty. He restored the capitol to its ancient glory, and adorned it with a rich front; he built several palaces and other public structures at Rome, and died crowned with glory in 1564. His body was buried in the church of the apostles at Rome, but the grand duke of Tuscany had it removed to Florence, where it was interred with princely honours. His most famous painting is the last judgment, painted for Paul III. in which he indulged a satirical vein by introducing among the damned a cardinal who was his enemy. Michael Angelo was also a good poet, and some of his sonnets and canzonets were, published by his great-nephew at Florence in 1627.",,,,1564.0,d.,45.0,Pa,d. (LL),89.0,,64,Angelo M,M.

,,Anselm,Watkins,"Archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Aost, in Piedmont, in 1033. He became a monk in the abbey of Bec in Normandy, of which he became abbot. In 1093 he was made archbishop of Canterbury by William Rufus, to whom he had been confessor But soon after differences arose between the king and the archbishop, which were aggravated by the obstinate attachment of the latter to the pope's authority. The archbishop left the kingdom, and as soon as he was gone, the king seized upon his revenues. Anselm went to Rome, and was honourably entertained by the pope, whom he accompanied to the council of Bari, where he distinguished himself by refuting the objections of the Greeks with respect to the procession of the Holy Ghost. The pope afterwards deserted Anselm, who went to Lyons, where he resided till the death of William, when he returned to England, and was received with great respect; but a new rupture arose, occasioned by the archbishop's refusing to be reinvested by the king; on which the dispute was referred to the pope, who decided in favour of Anselm. This induced the nobility to advise the king to break absolutely with Rome, for which some of them were excommunicated: at length the pope made a concession, by allowing the English bishops and abbots to do homage to the king for their temporalities, which restored Anselm to favour. He died at Canterbury in 1109. His works were printed at Cologne in 1612, and at Lyons in 1630.

,,Anson (George Lord),Watkins,"Was born at his father's seat in Staffordshire, in 1697. He went to sea very early, and in 1724 was made post-captain. Being sent to South Carolina, he purchased land, and built a town there, called after his name. In 1739 he was chosen commander of an expedition against the Spanish settlements in South America, and sailed from Portsmouth September 18, 1740, with five men of war, a sloop, and two victuallers. He doubled Cape Horn in March, 1741, after losing two of his ships. In June following he arrived off Juan Fernandez, with only two ships and two tenders. This place he left in September, took some prizes, burnt Paita, and continued on the American coast, in expectation of falling in with the annual Acapulco ship, till May 1742; when having only his own ship, the Centurion, of 64 guns, left, he crossed the southern ocean for China, where he staid several months, and then returned in quest of the galleon, which he fell in with, and captured after a smart action. Having sold his prize in China, he sailed for England, and arrived at Spithead, June 15, 1744, having sailed, in a fog, through the midst of a French fleet then cruizing in the channel. Not long after his return he was made rearadmiral of the blue, and one of the lords of the admiralty. He was also chosen member of parliament for the borough of Pleydon. In 1747 he commanded the channel fleet, and captured six French men-of-war, and four East-Indiamen. For these services he was created lord Anson, and on the death of sir John Norris, he was named vice-admiral of England. In 1751 he was appointed first lord of the admiralty, which post he held, with a short interval, till his death. In 1758 he again commanded the channel fleet, having under him the gallant sir Edward Hawke. After this he was appointed admiral and commander-in chief of his majesty's fleets. The last service he was engaged in, was in convoying to England her present majesty. He died in 1762. He married a daughter of the earl of Hardwicke, who died before him without issue. Lord Anson was a cool and steady man, but too fond of play, of which knowing little, he was the constant dupe of sharpers; this made some person say, that ""though he had been round the world, he was never in it.""",,,,1762.0,d.,45.0,,d.,,,149,Anson,Anson,22.0,Statesmen and Warriors,Great Britain,127.0,male,192.0,D,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Anson,_1st_Baron_Anson",1717.0,1762.0,case2
,,Antonius (Marcus),Watkins,"The triumvir, was the grandson of the preceding [Antonius, Marcus], and son of M. Antonius Creticus, by Julia, a noble lady of great merit. On the death of his father he led a very dissipated life. Afterwards he applied to the art of war, and shewed great courage and address in restoring Ptolemy to the throne of Egypt. He next served in Gaul with great reputation under Caesar, who enabled him to go to Rome, where he obtained the questorship, in which office he became very active in behalf of his benefactor. He assisted Caesar in gaining possession of the sovereign power, and was made by him governor of Italy, and commander of the legions, in which office his liberality endeared him to the soldiers. Caesar afterwards appointed him master of the horse for his conduct at the battle of Pharsalia, and chose him as his colleague in the consulship B. C. 44, On the death of Caesar, Antony behaved with great art, first getting the acts of his colleague confirmed by the senate, and next that he should have a public funeral, at which he made a harangue in his favour, which produced such an effect on the populace, that Brutus and Cassius were obliged to quit the city. He then began to exercise his authority in such a manner, as to convince all parties that he meant to assume the sovereignty. The patriots, to check his career, espoused the cause of Octavianus. the heir, of Caesar, on which Antony retired to his government of Cisalpine Gaul, and began a civil war by laying siege to Mertina, now Modena. The consuls Hirtius and Pansa, with Octavianus, were sent against him, and though Antony was defeated, both consuls were slain, and Octavianus found himself at the head of a victorious army. After his defeat Antony crossed the Alps, and joined Lepidus, with whom and Octavianus he contrived to form the second triumvirate, to which Cicero fell a victim through the personal revenge of Antony. After the defeat of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi, he went into Asia, and outrivalled all other princes by the splendour of his court. Here Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, captivated him by her charms, and he accompanied her to Alexandria, where he gave himself up to pleasure. In the mean time Octavianus, at the instigation of Fulvia, the wife of Antony, commenced hostilities in Italy; but a reconciliation being effected between them, Antony married Octavia, the sister of his colleague. A new division of the empire was the consequence of this alliance, the west being allotted to Octavianus, and the east to Antony, and Africa to Lepidus. Antony soon after renewed his intercourse with Cleopatra in so shameful a manner, that he was deprived of his consular dignity, and war was declared against the Egyptian queen by the Senate. Immense preparations were making on both sides, but Antony was immersed in dissipation, which destroyed his military spirit. At the battle of Actium he escaped in a small vessel, and finding himself deserted on all sides, he stabbed himself, B. C. 30, aged 56.",,,,-30.0,d.,45.0,,d.

His method of discovering the fraud of a jeweller, discovers the singular penetration of his mind. Hiero, suspecting that the crown he had ordered did not contain the quantity of gold which had been given to the workman, desired Archimedes to find out the fraud. His thoughts being intent upon this problem while he was in the bath, he observed that a quantity of water overflowed equal to the bulk of his body; which at once suggested to him a method of determining the question; and leaping out of the bath, he ran home, exclaiming as he went, I have found it! Then procuring two masses of gold and silver of equal weight with the crown, he carefully noticed the quantity of water which each displaced, after which he observed how much the crown caused to flow over; and on comparing this quantity with each of the former, he was able to ascertain the proportions of gold and silver in the crown. Some ancient authors celebrate a glass machine made by him, which represented the motions of the heavenly bodies. He is also said to have made burning-glass which destroyed ships at great distance. In the siege of Syracuse by Marcellus, Archimedes contrived a variety of machines for annoying the enemy; but the place was taken at last, and the Roman commander gave strict orders, that his house and person should be respected. He was, however, slain by a soldier, while he was deeply engaged in solving a geometrical problem, and inattentive to the noise occasioned by the taking of the city. This happened B. C. 208.

fl.,-620.0,Arion,Aikin,"a personage of great celebrity in the poetical story of antiquity, was a native of Methymne in the isle of Lesbos, where he attained high reputation, about B.C. 620, as a musician and poet. He is said to have been the inventor of the dithyrambic measure, and to have excelled in lyric poetry, which he sung to his lute. He was in great favour with Periander king of Corinth, who long entertained him at his court, and treated him with distinguished kindness. Thence he visited Italy and Sicily, practising in his profession, and accumulating by it great riches. Meaning to return to Greece, he embarked in a Corinthian vessel with all his effects. The sailors, tempted by such a prey, when out at sea, conspired to take his life, and were proceeding to throw him overboard, when he requested to be permitted to sing one funeral strain before his death. They complied; and standing on the prow, dressed in his robe of ceremony, with his instrument in his hand, he chanted with a loud voice his sweetest elegy, and threw himself into the sea. A dolphin (says the fable), charmed with his music, swam to him while floating on the waves, bore him up on his back, and carried him safely to Cape Taenarus in Sparta, whence he returned to his patron Periander. The sailors, who thought him dead, put in at Corinth, and, being confounded by his appearance against them, paid the penalty of their cruel purpose with their lives. This story seems to have been universally credited by antiquity, and has been a frequent subject of poetry and sculpture.",,,,,,47.0,Mu,fl.,,,65,Arion,Arion,22.0,Artists Poets,,43.0,male,258.0,A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arion,-650.0,-605.0,case3

Aristides was held in the highest esteem by all the confidential states of Greece, and was appointed by them to regulate the proportionate assessments which they were to pay for the support of the war. In this he acted with so much wisdom and justice, as to gain universal admiration. He died very poor about 467 B. C.

,,Aristotle,Watkins,"The head of the peripatetic sect, was born at Stagyra, in Thrace, B. C. 384. He was the son of Nicomachus, physician to Amyntas, grandfather of Alexander the Great. He lost his parents when young, on which, it is said, he led such a dissipated life as to squander away his estate; but others assert, that he became a pupil of Plato at the age of seventeen. He studied with indefatigable diligence under that great philosopher, to whom, however, some charge him with being guilty of base ingratitude. On the death of Plato he went to the court of Hermias, at Atarna, in Mysia, and married that prince's sister. He was afterwards sent for by Philip of Macedon to take upon him the tuition of Alexander, and gave such satisfaction to the king, that he erected statues to his honour, and for his sake rebuilt Stagyra. On the accession of Alexander to the throne, Aristotle refused to accompany him in his expedition, but recommended to him his relation Calisthenes, and then settled at Athens, where the magistrates gave him the Lyceum, in which he taught his philosophy to a great number of disciples. Here he composed his principal works, particularly his animal history, which he undertook at the request of Alexander, who supplied him with subjects, and liberally rewarded him. Being accused of impiety, he wrote an apology for himself, addressed to the magistrates, but he soon after quitted Athens, and spent the remainder of his days at Chalcis, a city in Euboea. Some say that he put an end to himself by poison; others that he cast himself into the river Euripus, because he could not comprehend the reason of its ebbing and flowing; and some assert, that he died of the colic, in the 63d year of his age, B. C. 323. His body was carried away by his countrymen, who erected altars to his memory. His works may be classed under the heads of rhetoric, poetry, politics, ethics, physics, mathematics, logic, and metaphysics; and, in the words of an elegant writer, ""whoever surveys the variety and perfection of his productions, all delivered in the chastest style, in the clearest order, and the most pregnant brevity, is amazed at the immensity of his genius.""

He delivered Italy from the barbarians, reduced Tetricus, who had assumed the title of emperor in Gaul, and conquered Zenobia, queen of Palmyra. After these victories he entered Rome in triumph, attended by his illustrious captives, to whom he behaved in the most generous manner, presenting Zenobia with a villa at Tibur, and restoring Tetricus to his rank as senator.

,,Antoninus (Marcus Aurelius),Watkins,"Surnamed the Philosopher, emperor of Rome, was born A. D. 121. He altered his name in complaisance to the Aurelian family, by whom he was adopted. When Adrian chose Antoninus Pius for his successor, it was on condition that he should adopt Marcus Aurelius for his. In consequence he married Faustina, the daughter of that emperor, by whom he had several children. On the death of Pius he entered on the government, and chose for his colleague Lucius Verus, his son-in-law, whose character was the reverse of that of Antoninus. Verus died in 163, and thus the government, to the joy of the empire, devolved solely on Antoninus, who continued to prosecute the German war with vigour; but in 174, being blocked up by the Quadi in a disadvantageous situation, the army was on the point of perishing either by the enemy, or by thirst, when on a sudden the sky was overcast, and there fell a vast quantity of rain. At this juncture the enemy attacked the Romans, and would have defeated them had not a thunder-storm come on, which frightened the barbarians, and put them to the rout. Pagans and Christians are agreed in the truth of this prodigy, but they account for it on different grounds; the first attribute it to a magician or to Jupiter, and the latter to the prayers of the twelfth legion, consisting of Christians, and which was in consequence honoured by the emperor with the title of the thundering legion. In 177 he chose his son Commodus to be consul, though only sixteen years old; he also honoured him with the title of imperator, and entered Rome with him in triumph, on account of his German victories. He remitted all the debts due to himself and the public treasury, and applied zealously to the reformation of abuses, and the formation of beneficial regulations. In particular, he restrained the brutalities of the public games, and ordered that the gladiators should fight with foils. He died in 180, and his memory was so revered that the Romans enrolled him among their household deities. His Meditations have been translated into english by Collier, 8vo.",,,,180.0,d.,49.0,,d.

Soon afterwards he put Morad and his other brother, Dara, to death. He behaved tenderly however to his father, who died in 1666. Aureng-zebe greatly enlarged his dominions, and became so formidable, that all the eastern princes sent him ambassadors.

,,Augustine (St.),Watkins,"A father of the church, was born at Tagaste, in Africa, in 854. His father was a plebeian, and his mother Monica was a woman of exemplary piety. Though he had all the advantage of a good education he squandered awry his time in debauchery. In 371 his father sent him to Carthage, where he led a dissipated life, and became a convert to the manichees. In 380 he taught rhetoric at Carthage with great reputation, but still continued his licentious Course of life, and kept a woman publicly, by whom he had a son named Adeodatus. His mother took uncommon pains to bring him back to virtue, but finding all her endeavours ineffectual, she had recourse only to prayer on his behalf. Wearied with his situation in Africa, Augustine removed to Rome, where he taught rhetoric with great applause, and in 383 was appointed professor of rhetoric at Milan. Here the sermons of St. Ambrose effected a conversion. He renounced his heretical notions, and was baptised in 887. The next year he returned to Africa, and was ordained priest. He was at first the coadjutor of Valerius, bishop of Hippo, and afterwards his successor. He died in 430. His writings have always been held in veneration by the catholic church, and from them was formed that system commonly called scholastic divinity.

,,"Augustin Or Austin, (St.)",Watkins,"The first archbishop of Canterbury, was a Roman monk, and sent by Gregory I. with 40 others, to convert the inhabitants of this island, about 596. On landing in Thanet, they informed king Ethelbert of their business, When the king assigned them Canterbury for their residence, with permission to exercise their function. The good monarch himself embraced Christianity, but never attempted to bring over his subjects by force. Augustin was consecrated at Arles archbishop and metropolitan of the church. He fixed his seat at Canterbury, and endeavoured to form a correspondence with the Welsh bishops, for Christianity had long before been settled in Wales. A conference was accordingly held between Augustin and some monks from the monastery of Bangor. These fathers, it is said, before their departure from Wales, applied to an old hermit for advice how to act, who told them, that if Augustin was a man of God, they should submit to be directed by him; and, on their asking how they were to know this, he said, ""if on your arrival in his presence he rises to salute you, he is God's messenger; but if not, he is haughty and proud, you ought to have no more to do with him."" When they came to the assembly, Augustin received them sitting, in consequence of which the Welshmen opposed all measures of accommodation. The points in Which they were required to yield were, the celebration of Easter, the mode of administering baptism, and the acknowledgment of the pope's authority.

,,Bacon (Francis),Watkins,"An illustrious philosopher and eminent statesman, was the son of Nicholas Bacon by his second wife, and born In London in 1561. When a child he gave such early indications of future eminence, that queen Elizabeth used to call him her ""young chancellor."" He was educated at Trinity college, Cambridge, and while a student discovered the futility of the peripatetic philosophy, which then prevailed, At the age of sixteen he went to France in the suite of sir Amias Pawlet, ambassador to that court. During his residence there he wrote an acute piece, On the State of Europe, which displayed great observation, though he was then but nineteen years of age. On his return to England he entered of Gray's-inn, and at the age of twentyeight was appointed one of the queen's counsellors. But by his attachment to that earl of Essex, who was at enmity with Cecil, Bacon lost those advantages at court which he 'might otherwise have expected. That generous but unfortunate earl, however, feeling the value of his attachment, presented him with a valuable estate; an act of friendship which Bacon ill requited by appearing against him at his trial. Its 1593 he was chosen member of parliament, And had the courage to oppose several arbitrary measures of the court, for which he incurred the queen's displeasure. On the accession of James I. he obtained the honour of knighthood, and in 1604 was appointed one of the king's counsel, with a pension. The next year he published a great work, entitled The Advancement and Proficiency of Learning, for which he was made solicitor general. About this time he married a daughter of Mr. Barnham, a rich alderman of London. In 1611 he was appointed judge of the marshalsea court, and obtained the place of register of the star-chamber, the reversion of which had been granted him twenty years before. In 1613 he was made attorney-general; and in 1616 sworn of the privy council. At this time he contracted a close intimacy with the favourite George Villiers, to whom he wrote an admirable letter of advice. In 1617 he was made lord keeper of the great seal, and two years after constituted high chancellor of Great Britain at which time he was advanced to the peerage by the title of baron of Verulam, and the year following was created viscount St. Albans. In 1620 he published the most elaborate of all his works, the Novum Organum Scientiarum, shewing a perfect method of exercising the faculty of reason. The year following he was accused in parliament of bribery and corruption in his high office, which heavy charge being admitted by his own confession, he was sentenced to pay a fine of 40,000/. to be imprisoned during the king's pleasure, and for ever rendered incapable of holding any public office. He was soon restored to liberty, had his fine remitted, and was summoned to the first parliament of king Charles. It must not be omitted, that the greatest part of the blame attaches to his servants, and of this he was sensible; for dluring his trial, as he passed through the room where his domestics were sitting, they all rose up at his entrance, on which he said, ""Sit down, my masters, your rise hath been my fall."" After this disgrace he went into retirement, where he devoted himself to his studies. Notwithstanding his pension of 1800/. a year, and his paternal estate, which was worth 700/. a year, his liberality Was so great, that at his death, in 1626, his debts amounted to 22,000/. His remains were interred in St. Michael's church, at St. Albans, where his secretary, sir Thomas Mcautys, erected a monument to his memory. His writings are an inestimable measure of sound wisdom, and were published in an elegant form in 1778, 5 vols. 4to. and lately in. 10 vols. 8vo.

,,Bacon (Roger),Watkins,"An English philosopher, was born at Ilchester, in Somersetshire, in 1214, and educated at Oxford, under the auspices of Robert Grosthead, bishop of Lincoln, who was through life his great patron. Bacon was also encouraged and instructed in learning by Edmund Rich, archbishop of Canterbury, William Shirwood, chancellor of Lincoln and an excellent mathematician, and Richard Fishacre, an able professor at Oxford and Paris. The last mentioned university being at that time greatly frequented by students on account of the learned lectures there delivered, Bacon, after laying in a good store of knowledge at home, went thither, and studied with so much diligence and success as to obtain the degree of D. D. On quitting France he retired to Oxford, and about the same. time, A. D. 1240, entered into the order of St Francis. He now devoted himself principally to chemistry, natural philosophy, and mathematics, and so ardent was he in making experiments as to spend in the course of twenty years 2000/. entirely on these pursuits, which, considering the time he lived in, was a prodigious sum. The discoveries he made, and the celebrity he obtained, excited the envy and malice, of the monks. It was reported, and believed, that he had recourse to the agency of evil spirits, and that all his knowledge consisted in his profound skill as a magician. In consequence of this, he was forbidden to read lectures in the university, and was even confined to his cell without being allowed to see his friends, or to have a proper supply of food. This bigoted and cruel conduct of the monks seems only to have extended his reputation, for while he was under persecution by the monks he received a letter from the cardinal bishop of Sabina, the pope's legate in England, requesting a copy of his works, which Bacon at first declined; but when that prelate was raised to the papal chair by the name of Clement IV. he collected his writings into a volume, entitled Opus Majus, or the Greater Work, and sent them to his holiness, who promised him his protection. This tranquillity, however, did not long continue, for on the death of that pope he was exposed to new and more severe persecutions. His works were prohibited, and he was sentenced to close imprisonment, in which he remained above ten years. On being released he retired to Oxford, where he died June 11, 1292. The uncommon attainments of Bacon obtained for him, according to the custom of that age, the appellation of ""the wonderful doctor,"" and it must be allowed that no man ever deserved it better. Bishop Bale mentions above eighty treatises written by this great man, of which he had himself seen near forty; and Dr. Jebb, the learned editor of his Opus Majus, in 1 vol. folio, 1733, classes his writings under these heads; grammar, mathematics, physics, optics, geography, astronomy, chronology, chemistry, magic, medicine, logic, metaphysics, ethics, theology, philology, and miscellanies. It must, however, be confessed, that one and the same work by him has in other copies borne another title. His chemical tracts are in the Thesaurus Chemicus, printed at Tranckfort, in 8vo. 1620. His treatise on the ""Means of avoiding the Infirmities of old Age,"" was first printed at Oxford in 1590; and an English translation of it, by Dr. Browne, appeared in 1683. Several pieces by him yet remain in MS, particularly one on chronology, entitled Computus Rogeri Baconis; another, called Liber Naturalium, and the Compendium of Theology, are in the king's library. Bacon was a considerable mathematician, and from some of his pieces in MS. it appears that he had a knowledge of the nature of convex and concave glasses, and some consider him as the inventor of the telescope. He also gives descriptions which correspond with the camera obscura and burning glass. His acquaintance with astronomy and geography was likewise very extensive and accurate. He detected the errors in the calendar, and suggested that reformation in it which was long afterwards adopted by Gregory XIII. In chemistry he appears to have been misled by the delusion which imposed upon other great men in more enlightened times than the one he lived in, that it was possible to transmute metals into gold. Yet this delusion has been the friend of experimental science, and Bacon in pursuing it discovered many secrets which modern philosophers have arrogated to themselves. In particular, he gives such a description of a certain composition and its powerful effects as proves he was not unacquainted with gunpowder.",,,,1292.0,d.,50.0,M,d. (LL),78.0,,94,"Bacon, Roger",R.

In 1160 he was sent to Paris to negociate a marriage between prince Henrv, and the king of France's eldest daughter, with whom hereturned to England. In 1162 he was elected archbishop of Canterbury, on which he resigned the chancellorship, and assuming the arrogance of a sovereign pontiff, came to hostilities with the king, who endeavoured to effect a reform among the clergy. In a convention held at Clarendon, laws were passed respecting the privileges of the church, to which Becket assented at first, but afterwards retracted, and endeavoured to leave the kingdom to communicate his grievances to the pope. This occasioned a parliament to be called at Northampton in 1165, when the archbishop was sentenced to forfeit all his goods to the king. On this he left the kingdom, and Henry seized upon the revenues of his see. Becket resigned at Sens his archbishopric into the hands of the pope, who returned it to him with assurances of support. The prelate now fulminated his anathemas against several bishops and noblemen, which so irritated the king, that he banished all his relations. In 1167 an interview took place between Henry and Becket in Champagne, which ended without producing any effect. In 1169 another attempt was made to bring about a reconciliation, which also failed through the obstinacy of the archbishop, and Henry was so exasperated, that he obliged his subjects to renounce, by oath, all obedience to Becket and the pope. He also caused his son to be crowned at Westminster by the archbishop of York; for which the pope suspended that prelate, and excommunicated those who assisted him. An accommodation was at last concluded, but Becket refusing to withdraw his excommunication of the bishops, they laid their complaints before Henry, who was in Normandy. In a fit of passion the king exclaimed how unhappy he was, that among so many attendants, none had gratitude enough to rid him of one who caused him so much disturbance. On this, four knights set out for Canterbury, and assassinated the archbishop at the altar of his cathedral, Dec. 29, 1171. For this the king was obliged by the pope to do penance at Becket's tomb, where he was scourged by the monks, and passed the whole day and night fasting upon the bare stones. The murderers were sent on penance to the holy land, where they died.

,,Bentley (Richard),Watkins,"A celebrated divine and critic, was born at (Fulton, in Yorkshire, in 1661 From Wakefield school he removed at the age of 15, to St. John's college, Cambridge; but he took the degree of M. A. at Oxford, where he accompanied the son of bishop Stillingfleet as private tutor. He was also chaplain to that prelate, who gave him a prebend in his cathedral. In 1691 he published a Latin epistle to Dr. Mill, containing critical Observations on the Chronology of John Malala. He was the first who preached the lecture founded by Mr. Boyle, on which occasion he delivered eight admirable discourses in confutation of atheism. In 1693 he was appointed keeper of the royal library. In 1697 commenced his famous controversy with the honourable Mr. Boyle on the genuineness of the epistles of Phalaris, in which much personal abuse passed on both sides; but though some of the greatest wits of the age aided Boyle on this occasion, impartial posterity have determined the case in favour of Bentley. About this time he was presented to the mastership of Trinity-college, Cambridge, with which he held the archdeaconry of Ely. But he was soon brought into trouble; for, in consequence of some encroachments made by him in the college for his own emolument, a charge was laid against him, which never came to a determination; but afterward when he was regius professor of divinity, having exacted an exorbitant fee from persons who were admitted to the degree of D. D. by mandate, he was suspended in the vice-chancellor's court. This arbitrary decree was reversed by the court of kings bench, and the doctor was restored to his privileges. He died in 1742. Dr. Bentley is advantageously known as a critic by his editions of Horace, Terence, and Phaedrus. His intended edition of the Greek Testament never appeared, owing to an attack made on the prospectus by Dr. Middleton. He was also the author of an excellent answer to Collins's Discourse on Free-Thinking, and published an edition of Milton's Paradise Lost.",,,,1742.0,d.,51.0,Cr,d.

,,Berkeley (George),Watkins,"A celebrated divine, was born at Kilcrin, in Ireland, in 1684. He was educated first at Kilkenny, and next at Trinity-college, Dublin, of which he was chosen fellow in 1707. The same year he published Arithmetica absque Algebra aut Euclide demonstrata. In 1709 he published his Theory of Vision. In 1710 appeared the Principles of Human Knowledge, and in 1713 the Dialogues between Hylas and Philonus, the object of both being to disprove the common notion of the existence of matter, and to establish the hypothesis that material objects have no other existence than in the mind. However singular his opinions were, there was so much beauty in his writings that the greatest men courted his friendship, among whom were Steele and Swift. For the former he wrote several papers in the Guardian, and by his means became intimate with Pope. Swift recommended him to the earl of Peterborough, who took him abroad in quality of his chaplain. In 1714 he returned to England, but soon afterwards set out again for the continent, with a son of Dr. Ashe, bishop of Clogher, and continued on his travels four years; he returned in 1721, and became chaplain to the duke of Grafton, lord lieutenant of Ireland. At this time he took his degree of D. D. and a fortune was bequeathed to him by a lady of Dublin. In 1724 he was promoted to the deartry of Derry, and the year following he printed a proposal for converting the American Indians, by erecting a college in the Bermudas: his mind was so intent on this scheme, that he obtained a grant of 10,000/. from the commons, and set sail for America, where he resided near two years; but the project failed, owing to the minister's applying the money to other purposes. In 1732 he published the Minute Philosopher, in 2 vols. 8vo. which is a masterly attack on infidelity. The next year he was made bishop of Cloyne, and about this time he published the Analyst, in which he endeavoured to prove that the mathematicians admitted mysteries, and even falsities in science, particularly instancing the doctrine of fluxions. He was answered by several writers, to whom he replied in 1739, in a Defence of Freethinking in Mathematics. In 1736 he published the Querist, addressed to magistrates, occasioned by the licentiousness of the times. In 1744 appeared his book on the virtues of tarwater. He died suddenly, in 1753, at Oxford, and was buried in Christchurch, where there is a monument to his memory. Pope said no less justly than beautifully of him, ""To Berkeley every virtue under heaven.""

In 1676 he set out on his travels, and at Geneva devised a method of teaching a blind girl to write. He wrote a treatise on the comet which appeared in 1680, and soon after went to Holland, where he studied the new philosophy. From thence he crossed over to England, where he formed an intimacy with Mr. Boyle and other great men. He returned to Basil in 1682, and read lectures on experimental philosophy and mechanics. About 1684, Leibnitz published, in the Acta Eruditorum at Leipsic, some essays on his new calculus differentialis, but without discovering the method. Bernouilli, however, and his brother, found out the secret, for which they received the applause of Leibnitz.

,,Blake (Robert),Watkins,"A gallant admiral, was born at Bridgewater, in Somersetshire, in 1599, and educated at Oxford, where he took the degree of B. A. in 1617. Being of a grave and severe temper he joined with the puritans, by whose influence he was chosen to represent his native town in the parliament which met in 1640, but lost his election for the next. At the beginning of the rebellion he took the part of the parliament, and served under colonel Fiences, at Bristol, when it was taken by prince Rupert. He next assisted in taking Taunton by surprize, of which place he was made governor, and defended it against Goring with such bravery that he was publicly thanked and rewarded by parliament. In 1649 he was appointed commander of the fleet, in conjunction with Deane and Popham; and soon afterwards sailed in quest of prince Rupert, whom he blocked up in Kinsale harbour. The prince afterwards escaped to Lisbon, whither he was followed by Blake, who demanded leave of the king of Portugal to attack him, and being refused he took several Brazil ships. When he was gone, prince Rupert sailed into the Mediteranean, whither he was followed by Blake, who attacked him in the harbour of Malaga, and destroyed nearly the whole of his fleet, he then returned to England with several prizes, and received the thanks of parliament, by whom he was made warden of the cinque ports. Soon after this he reduced the Scilly isles and Guernsey, for which he was made one of the council of state. On the prospect of a Dutch war in 1652 he Was Appointed sole admiral, and was attacked in the Downs by Tromp, who had 45 sail, and Blake only 23. However, he fought so bravely, that the Dutch admiral was glad to retreat. In November following Tromp sailed into the Downs, with above 80 sail of men of war, where, after an obstinate battle, he obtained a partial victory at a dear rate. But so elated was he with it that he passed through the channel with a broom at his maintop, signifying that he had swept the sea of the English ships. In February 1655 Blake put to sea with 60 men of war, and soon after met with the Dutch admiral, who had 70 sail, and 300 merchantmen under convoy. A most bloody engagement ensued, that lasted three days, in which the Dutch lost 11 men of war, and 30 merchant vessels. The loss of the English was only one ship. In June following the fleets of the two republics fought again off the Foreland; and if the Dutch had not saved themselves on Calais sands all their ships must have been taken. In 1654 he sailed into the Mediterranean, where he demolished the castle of Tunis because they refused to deliver up the English captive. A squadron of his ships, under the command of captain Stayner, intercepted a Spanish plate fleet, and took the admiral, vice-admiral, and two galleons. Blake having received information that another plate fleet lay at Santa Cruz, in Tenerife, sailed thither, and notwithstanding the strength of the place he boldly went in, burnt the ships, and came out without any loss. Finding his health declining fast he resolved to return to England, but died as the fleet was entering Plymouth, August 27, 1658. His body was interred in Henry the Vllth's chapel, Westminster-abbey, from whence it was removed at the restoration, and buried in St. Margaret's church-yard,",,,,1657.0,d.,52.0,,d.

In 1701 he read lectures upon the institutes of physic; and in 1709 was appointed professor of medicine and botany. In 1714 he was chosen rector of the university, and displayed so much spirit against cartesianism as to rouse the resentment of the friends of that system against him; particularly a theological professor at Franeker, who charged Boerhaave with being a deist; for which the furious divine was obliged by his own university to make an apology. In 1713 he was nominated professor of chemistry, a science which he greatly improved. His fame was spread over the world; he was chosen a member of the academy of sciences at Paris, and of the royal society of London; and a Chinese mandarin is said to have written him a letter with this direction, ""to the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe.""

,,Boyle (Robert),Watkins,"A celebrated philosopher, was the seventh son of Richard, earl of Cork, and was born at Lismore in Ireland, in 1627. Two misfortunes happened to him in his childhood; the first was the loss of his mother, and the second, an incurable habit of stuttering, which he acquired by mocking other children. In 1635 he was sent to Eton school, and three years afterwards accompanied his brother Francis in his travels. They settled some time at Geneva where, among other studies, Mr. Boyle applied to the mathematics, of which he had before acquired the rudiments. After a stay of near two years at Geneva they visited Italy, where Mr. Boyle paid particular attention to the discoveries made by Galileo. The rebellion in Ireland having embarrassed their father's affairs, they were straitened in their circumstances abroad from the want of remittances. After experiencing many difficulties in this respect they returned to England in 1644, and found that their father was dead. To his son Robert he had bequeathed the manor of Stalbridge, where he chiefly resided; but when in London he lived with his sister, lady Ranelagh. He now devoted himself to philosophical pursuits, for which purpose he made frequent excursions to Oxford, where a philosophical society was held, which afterwards became the famous royal society, of which he was one of the earliest members. In 1654 he fixed his residence at Oxford, for the sake of enjoying the company of his learned friends. Here he applied principally to experimental philosophy, and contrived a more perfect air-pump than that which had been recently invented. But natural philosophy was not the only subject which engaged his attention at Oxford. He cultivated an acquaintance with the learned languages, and devoted so much time to the study of theology and sacred criticism, that at the restoration he was pressed to enter into orders, with a view of elevating him to episcopacy. But a natural diffidence made him decline this and every other offer of preferment. He was also of opinion, that as a layman what he should write in behalf of religion would make more impression than if he were an ecclesiastic. His labours were so incessant that he continued to enrich the papers of the royal society by the communications of experiments; and as he was one of the first institutors, so he was the principal support and ornament of that establishment. He also exerted himself in other works, particularly in advancing designs of charity, and schemes of improvements. As a director of the East India company he was the principal instrument in procuring their charter; for which he only required as a return, that they would do something towards propagating Christianity in their settlements, to which end he had printed at Oxford 500 copies of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, in the Malay tongue. He was also at the expence of printing in Arabic Grotius de Veritate. In 1678 he published an extraordinary piece, entitled, An Historical Account of a Degradation of Gold made by an Anti-elixir, 4to. In the same year the royal society would have chosen him president, which honour he declined. About 1681 we find him engaged in promoting the propagation of the gospel among the Indians of North America. In 1689 he was obliged to have recourse to an advertisement to prevent the intrusion of visitors. By this means he gained time to perfect some important works, particularly those of chemistry. He died in 1691, in a week after his sister, lady Ranelagh. His remains were interred in the church of St. Martin in the Fields where a funeral sermon was preached by Dr. Burnet, bishop of Salisbury. He founded a lecture at St. Paul's in defence of the gospel against unbelievers, without any regard to differences among Christians.

By reading religious books he became dissatisfied with the Roman church, and fled to Geneva in 1502; but disliking the intolerant spirit of Calvin and Beza, he went to Paris, where he attracted notice by attacking the Aristotelian philosophy. He next visited England, and formed an acquaintance with sir Fulk Greville and sir Philip Sidney, In 1589 he was at Helmstadt, where he pronounced a funeral oration on the duke of Brunswick. He afterwards imprudently ventured into Italy, and was arrested at Venice, fiom whence he was removed to Rome, where, after two years imprisonment, he was burnt in 1600. He was a man of talents, positive, vain, and singularly obscure in his ideas. This has given occasion to call him an atheist, because he opposed in a perplexed style the philosophy of the schools, it must be allowed, however, that if he was not an atheist, he had little or no regard to religion, as appears from his celebrated book, Spaccio de la Bestial Triomphante, (the Demolition of the Triumphant Beast). He was also the author of an Italian comedy called il Candelajo, and of some Latin poetry.",,,Bayle,1600.0,d.,53.0,D,d.,,,112,Bruno Jordano,Bruno,13.0,Divines and Metaphysicians &cc,Italy,99.0,male,450.0,D,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno,1555.0,1600.0,case2

The consulship was then instituted, when Brutus and Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia, were chosen the first to hold that dignity.

James V. employed him as a tutor to his natural son, the earl of Moray; and at the same king's command he attacked the franciscans in a satirical poem, for which his life being threatened he fled to England, and thence to France, where he wrote four tragedies in latin. He next went to Portugal, and became a teacher of philosophy in the university of Coimbra, but expressing some free opinions, he was confined in a monastery, in which he translated David's Psalm into Latin. In 1551 he obtained his liberty, and after residing some time in France and England, returned to his native country, where he was appointed principal of the college of St. Leonard in the university of St. Andrew's. This favour he obtained from queen Mary, which he ill requited by writing a book called a Detection of her Doings, designed to prejudice the minds of her subjects against her. He was nominated tutor to James VI. and being afterwards reproached with making him a pedant, he replied, that, ""it was the best he could make of him."" He died at Edinburgh in 1582. Besides what is above mentioned he wrote Latin poems, some of which are beautiful. His History of Scotland is also elegantly written, but is not faithful.

The king also condescended to be his school-master, appointed him gentleman of the bedchamber, and knight of the garter. Honours and places were heaped on the favourite in rapid succession; he was advanced to the dignity of duke, made lord high admiral, master of the horse, and had the disposal of all places in church and state. He kept the same footing in the favour of Charles I. whom, when prince of Wales, he accompanied to Spain, to negociate a marriage with the infanta.

When Mary came to the throne he was dismissed from his employments; but he was respected, and often consulted, by the queen and her ministers. At the accession of Elizabeth he was appointed privy counsellor, secretary of state, and master of the court of wards. Soon afterwards he was chosen chancellor of Cambridge; and in 1571 advanced to the peerage. He died in 1598 having two sons.

,,Butler (Joseph),Watkins,"A learned prelate, was born at Wantage in Berkshire in 1692. His father, who was a dissenter, intended him for the ministry amongst those of the same persuasion and placed him under the learned Mr. Jones, who kept an academy at Tewksbury in Gloucestershire. While there he wrote a letter to Dr. Clarke containing remarks on, some of his arguments in his Treatise on the Being and Attributes of God, with which that great man was so pleased that he inserted them in his next edition. During his residence at Tewksbury he studied the subject of nonconformity, the result of which was, a determination to enter into the communion of the established church. Accordingly in 1714 he went to Oxford, and became a commoner of Oriel college, where he formed an intimacy with Mr. Talbot, son of the bishop of Durham; by whose interest he was appointed preacher at the Rolls, and successively rector of Houghton and Stanhope in the county of Durham. In 1736 he was made clerk of the closet to queen Caroline, who delighted much in his conversation. Two years afterwards he was preferred to the bishopric of Bristol, and in a short time made dean of St. Paul's, on which he resigned the rectory of Stanhope. In 1740 he was appointed clerk of the closet to the king, and in 1770 translated to the see of Durham. He died at Bath in 1752, and his remains were interred in Bristol cathedral.

,,Butler (Samuel),Watkins,"an English poet, was the son of a farmer at Strensham in Worcestershire, where he was born in 1600, or according to others in 1612. He received his education at Worcester school, from whence he removed to Cambridge, where he resided six or seven years, after which he became clerk to a justice of peace in his native county. He next went to live in the family of the countess of Kent, and was employed as amanuensis by the learned Selden. After this he resided with sir Samuel Luke in Bedfordshire, a gentleman very zealous in behalf of the covenant and puritanic principles. Here Butler became acquainted with the characters of the leading men of that party, and formed the plan of his poem, entituled Hudibras, the principal person of which was, unquestionably, sir Samuel. The idea of this exquisite piece, which gives so faithful a picture of the cant and hypocrisy of his times, was taken generally from Don Quixote; but the humour and the poetry are wholly Butler's, and in these he stands unrivalled. Some have objected to the jingling double rhymes in it, but these appear rather to add to the drollery of the exhibition, and to excite that ridicule which the author intended at the expence of the gloomy fanatics of his day. The learning and extensive reading of Butler are shewn to great advantage in this performance, a curious edition of, which was published by Dr. Zachary Grey, in 2 vols. 8vo. After the restoration Butler became secretary to the earl of Carberry, who appointed him steward of the court held at Ludlow castle. About this time also he married Mrs. Herbert, a lady of family and fortune. Much has been said about Butler's poverty, but either this is not well founded, or he must have been extravagant, for his employments and his marriage ought to have placed him above indigence. He died in London in 1680, and was buried in the church of St. Paul's, Covent-garden. In 1721 alderman Barber, the printer, erected a monument to his memory in Westminsterabbey. After his death were published his posthumous works, and in 1753 Mr. Thyer of Manchester published his genuine remains, in 2 vols. 8vo.",,,,1680.0,d.,53.0,P,d.

,,Caesar (Caius Julius),Watkins,"Was descended from the Julian family, and lost his father when young. He married the daughter of Cornelias Cinna, and was designed for the office of high priest to Jupiter, but was deprived of it by Sylla, who was Cinna's inveterate enemy. Sylla carried his revenge so far as to confiscate the property of Caesar, and even issued a proscription against him. By the mediation of several of the patricians, this decree was reversed: but Caesar, not thinking Rome a safe place, went to reside with Nicomedes, king of Bithynia. He obtained a civic crown for his conduct at the taking of Mitylene. On the death of Sylia he was recalled to Rome, and distinguished himself as an orator, by impeaching Dolabella for mal-administration in Greece. He studied rhetoric at Rhodes under Apollonius, and in his passage was taken by pirates, from whom he gained his liberty by paying a considerable ransom. He afterwards fitted out some ships, and having taken those plunderers caused them to be crucified. On his return to Rome he joined the party of Marius, and united with Cicero in promoting the Manilian law, which gained him the friendship of Pompey. The first dignity he obtained was that of military tribune, after which he served the offices of quaestor and aedile. In the latter station he gained popularity by his liberal donations, which greatly embarrassed his circumstances. He was suspected of being concerned in Cataline's conspiracy, owing perhaps to his recommending clemency to the culprits, in an oration which was severely answered by Cato. This conduct greatly lessened his reputation. On the death of his wife Cornelia he married Pompeia, from whom he procured a divorce for receiving Clodius into her house at the time of celebrating the rites of the bona Dea. He did not, however, persecute Clodius, and when asked why he had dismissed Pompeia, his answer was, that ""Caesar's wife should not even be suspected."" On the expiration of his praetorship he was appointed governor of the farther Spain: but finding it difficult to settle with his creditors, Crassus became his bondsman. On his way thither, passing through a miserable village on the Alps, his friends asking him whether he thought there were any contentions for offices in such a place? ""No"" replied he, ""but I would rather be the first man here than the second at Rome."" During his governorship he realized sufficient property to pay his debts, which are said to have amounted to a million and a half sterling. He next gained the consulship in conjunction with Bibulus, B.C. 59. At this time he formed the first triumvirate with Pompey and Crassus, the former of whom married his daughter Julia, and he himself married Calpurnia, daughter of L. Calpurnius Piso. In the following year he went into Gaul, where he distinguished himself as a military commander, in reducing the Belgians, Helvetians, and Nervians. In the fourth year of his government he crossed over to Britain, but did little more than reconnoitre the coast; on his next expedition he entered the Thames, and ravaged a great part of the country, taking several of the inhabitants as hostages. Having completely reduced Gaul to the condition of a Roman province, and acquired prodigious wealth, Pompey grew jealous of him, and the senate deprived him of his government. This being considered by him as a declaration of war, he crossed the Rubicon, a small river which parted Cisalpine Gaul from Italy, with a determination of revenging himself upon his enemies. His army was zealously attached to him, and success attended him every where on his march. Rome was filled with fear and confusion; and Pompey, with the magistrates, withdrew on his approach. Caesar entered the metropolis without his troops in an affected style of moderation. However, he seized upon the public treasury, which enabled him to complete the subjugation of the people. The civil war now raged with fury throughout the empire; but Caesar, by himself or his lieutenants, was every where triumphant, except in his blockade of Dyrrachium, where Pompey was encamped, who burst through the barrier after slaying considerable part of Caesar's forces. Caesar then retired to Macedonia, whither he was followed by Pompey, who was defeated on the plains of Pharsalia. Caesar next embarked for Alexandria, where the head of Pompey being brought to him, he burst into tears, and caused it to he solemnly interred. Here he entered into a war with Ptolemy, in which the famous Alexandrian library, containing 400,000 volumes, was accidentally burnt. This war was attended with various success, but Caesar's good fortune prevailed; the Egyptians were defeated, and Ptolemy was drowned. On the news of the death of Pompey the Roman senate proclaimed Caesar consul for five years, and created him dictator, thus placing the executive power in his hands. He next conquered Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates the great, in Asia Minor, on which occasion he wrote this laconic letter, ""Veni, Vidi, Vici; ""I came, I saw, I conquered."" After settling the affairs of Greece he proceeded to Rome, where he shewed his clemency, by pardoning all who had conspired against him in his absence. He next made an expedition into Africa, in the course of which he displayed great address and prudence in quelling a mutiny which broke out in his favourite legion. In this war he defeated Scipio, Labienus, and Juba; and drove Cato to the necessity of putting himself to death at Utica. At his return to Rome he behaved with great liberality to the people, and enacted several good laws. Among other reforms which he introduced, was that of the calendar, which bears the name of the Julian calendar. The two sons of Pompey having excited a revolt in Spain, Caesar marched thither, and after a bloody battle, succeeded in completing the subjugation of that country. His return to Rome was crowned with a triumph and the assumption of the imperial dignity, which roused the jealousy of several of his friends, who joined with the republicans in a conspiracy against his life. It is recorded of him, that a soothsayer bade him beware of the ides of March, and that his wife Calpurnia was so apprehensive that danger awaited him, as to dissuade him from going to meet the senate. The remonstrances, however, of Decimus Brutus, one of the conspirators, overruled his reluctance, and Caesar went to the senatehouse, where he was assassinated, B.C. 43, and in the 56th year of his age. Thus fell Julius Caesar, who on all accounts may justly be called a great man; for though he aspired to and obtained the supreme power, yet it does not appear that he abused it by any acts of tyranny or cruelty. His ambition was inordinate, but he was liberal and humane. His talents were of the first rank; and he might have shone as an orator if he had devoted himself to that profession's Cicero himself acknowledges. His literary powers appear to great advantage in his commentaries written in the true spirit of historical dignity and faithfulness. The best editions are those of Elzevir, 1661; Graevius, 1697; Clarke, London, 1712; Davis, Cambridge, 1727; and Barbou, Paris, 1755. This work has been translated into English by Bladen.

,,Caligula (Caius Caesar),Watkins,"A Roman emperor, was the son of Germanicus and Agrippina. When he was twenty he was adopted by Tiberius, to the great joy of the Roman people, with whom his father Germanicus had been a favourite. His first wife was Claudia, the daughter of a senator, but even while a boy he discovered the most abandoned deposition, having been detected in an intrigue with his own sister. On the death of Tiberius he was proclaimed emperor by the praetorian soldiers, and the nomination was confirmed by the senate, A. D. 37. The commencement of his reign was promising; he set at liberty the state prisoners, caused honours to be shewn to his deceased relatives, behaved with liberality to those who were living, and distributed large donations to the people. But this state was of short duration. He fell dangerously ill, and so greatly was he esteemed, that all orders were anxious in their supplications for his recovery. When, however, his health was restored, it was discovered that he was not the same man. His mind was either changed, or he had acted under the mask of hypocrisy. He began his career of wickedness by murdering several of his relations, who were followed by a number of senators, and other persons of high rank. He openly married his sister Brasilia, and on her death caused divine honours to be paid her, in temples built to her honour. For his favourite horse he built a palace with a marble stable, and an ivory rack; fed him with gilt barley, and wine out of a golden cup. It was even his intention at one time to make him consul. He married several wives, whom he put away one after the other. At last he attached himself to Cornelia, whose manners were as dissolute as his own. Cruelty in him became an inordinate habit, and he openly uttered the detestable wish, ""that the Roman people had but one neck, which he might sever in two at a blow."" His public exhibitions were extravagant and childish. He caused a bridge of boats to be constructed from Baiae to Puteali, on which were erected a number of castles, and after passing over it twice at the head of his troops, he caused the whole to be destroyed. In an expedition into Gaul he shewed his folly and cowardice on several occasions; but one of his most ridiculous exploits was in a pretended expedition against Britain. Having drawn up his whole army opposite the island, he commanded the trumpets to sound a charge and every preparation to be made for battle, when on a sudden the soldiers were ordered to fill their helmets with cockle-shells, and the farce ended with giving a trifling donation to the troops. He was about to follow this tip by the tragedy of decimating all the legions of the German army which had mutinied; but suspecting his intentions, those troops took up their arms, and stood on the defence. He then lied to Rome, where he revenged himself on the senate. At length a conspiracy was formed against him, headed by Cassius Chaerea, and the monster was assassinated as he was passing to the baths, A.D. 41, in the 29th year of his age. His wife and infant daughter were also sacrificed to the vengeance of the people, who caused his statues to be demolished, and all his public acts to be annulled.",,,,41.0,d.,54.0,,d.

,,Calvin (John),Watkins,"An eminent reformer, was born at Noyon in Picardy, in 1509, and educated at Paris under Corderius with a view to the church. Two benefices were procured for him, but having read the scriptures with great attention, he became dissatisfied with the tenets of the church of Rome, and altered his mind with respect to the ecclesiastical state. This change in his opinions induced him to study the law, in which he made a considerable progress; but his open avowal of the protestant faith rendered his stay in France dangerous, and he retired to Basil, where he published, in 1533, his Institution of the Christian Religion, to which he prefixed an elegant dedication to Francis I. This work rendered his name famous among all the reformed, and was translated into several languages. The year following he settled at Geneva as minister and professor of divinity, having Farel for his colleague. But soon after he was obliged to leave Geneva, together with Farel, for refusing the sacrament indiscriminately to the people. Calvin then went to Strasburg, where her officiated in a French church of his own establishment, and was also chosen professor of divinity. The divines of Strasburg appointed Calvin to be their deputy at the diet of Worms. In the mean time the citizens of Geneva requested his return to their city, and after repeated solicitations he consented, and arrived there in 1541. His first undertaking was to set on foot a system of ecclesiastical discipline, strictly presbyterian, and as rigorous and assuming as that of Rome itself. He continued in this city, actively employed as a preacher and a writer, till his death, which happened in 1564. The moral character of Calvin was irreproachable, and he appears to have acted from conscientious motives; but he was proud and overbearing. His creed was narrow, and the doctrine of predestination which he broached and explained caused bitter heats and confusions long after his death. His intolerance was manifested in his conduct to Servetus, but this was more the fault of the age than of the man. In all respects, however, he was a great character. He left a widow, by whom he had a son, who died an infant. Calvin's works make 9 vols. folio.",,,,1564.0,d.,54.0,D,d.

After residing at Geneva fourteen years he removed to Montpellier, where he filled the professor's chair; but being dissatisfied with his situation, he went to Paris in 1592, where he had the promise of a professorship, which he never obtained, and had the grant of a pension, which was badly paid. He was one of the protestant judges in the conference between Du Perron and Du Plessis Mornay in 1600, and gave his opinion against the latter, which occasioned a belief that he was about to change his re- ligion; and to effect it, cardinal du Perron was directed to have some communications with him on the subject, the result of which was Casaubon's inflexible resolution of abiding by the protestant principles.

In 1652 he made an observation of a comet; and determined the apogee and eccentricity of a planet from its true and mean place; a problem which Kepler had pronounced impossible. In 1653 he drew a meridian line in the great church at Bologna, on which Occasion a medal was struck. In 1663 he was appointed inspector-general of the fortifications of the castle of Urbino, and superintendant of the rivers in the ecclesiastical state. In 1666 he printed at Rome a collection of astronomical pieces, and a Theory of Jupiter's Satellites. Lewis XIV. desired leave of the pope for Cassini to come to Paris, which was granted, but the time of absence was limited to six years, at the expiration of which term he was commanded to return, and on his refusal his places were taken from him. Cassini was the first professor of the royal observatory, which was finished in 1670. Here he made numerous observations, and in 1684 he discovered four satellites of Saturn.

He delighted in scenes of riot, confusion, intestine wars, and murders. Such is the character given of him by Sallust, which is confirmed by other historians. Catiline was one of the most active ministers of Sylla, who procured his advancement to the qurestorship, and other high and lucrative offices. In the year B. C. 65 he formed a conspiracy with several abandoned young men, to murder the consuls and to overturn the government. This plot was discovered by Cicero, who was then consul, aud who delivered in the senate his famous oration against Catiline, in which he exposed all his abominable designs before his face. Catiline then left Rome, and put himself at the head of an army, on which the senate declared him a rebel. Those of his party which were left at Rome endeavoured to gain over to their side the ambassadors of the Allobroges, who were then at Rome. The ambassadors disclosed the whole to Cicero, and the conspirators were seized and punished. In the mean time Catiline was about to march into Transalpine Gaul, in hopes of being joined by that nation, but in this he was hindered by the proconsul Q.

By the interest of his friend Valerius Flaccus he was enabled to gain considerable preferment, and was appointed military tribune in Sicily, and afterwards quaestor in Africa under Scipio, in winch offices he displayed a strict economy in the expenditure of the public money. After going through other employments he was chosen consul, B.C. 195, in which station he had Valerius Flaccus for his colleague, and whom he opposed in his attempt to repeal the Oppianlaw. He conducted the war the further Spain with great success, and took no part of the spoils to his own share. On his arrival at Rome he was honoured with a triumph.

His parents died when he was a child, and left him in the care of his uncle Livius Drusus, a person of distinction. He manifested at an early age that inflexibility of disposition which marked the whole of his public conduct. His habits of austerity and frugality led him to embrace the doctrines of the Stoics. He served in the army with his brother Caepio against Spartacus, and displayed so much valour and prudence, as to obtain the commission of tribune in the army sent to Macedonia. In his civil character he served first the office of qaestor, which department he reformed of many abuses that had crept into it. His uprightness in administering justice gained him great popularity, and rendered his name proverbial for integrity. He gave his support to Cicero when that great man was consul, and publicly honoured him with the title of father of his country. He saw through the ambitious projects of Caesar, and opposed him with so much zeal that he sent him to prison; though he thought it expedient to release him almost immediately. He was afterwards sent into Asia to announce to Ptolemy king of Cyprus, the decree which deprived him of his dominions. That unhappy prince poisoned himself, and Cato seized on the royal treasure for the republic. He supported Pompey against Caesar, whose designs he considered as dangerous to the Roman liberty, yet the civil war which ensued filled him with grief. After the battle of Pharsalia, he retired to Africa, thinking that Pompey had fled thither. He and his troops endured great hardships in their march across the deserts, and at last joined Scipio at Utica, with whom he had some contest about the mode of carrying on the war. Cato also gave offence to that general by sparing those inhabitants of Utica who were attached to Caesar. When that conqueror came before the place, and Cato retired to his chamber and after reading Plato's Phaedo, or Dialogue on the Immortality of the Soul, fell upon his sword B.C. 45.

,,"Michael, Cerularius",Aikin,"patriarch of Constantinople in the eleventh century, was raised to that dignity in the year 1043. ^e was a person of a restless and ambitious spirit; a determined enemy to the church of Rome and the papal claims; and in the year 1053, the reviver of the famous contest between the Greek and Latin churches, which had been suspended for a considerable time. The pretexts which were employed to justify this new rupture, were zeal for the truth, and an anxious concern about the interests of religion; but its true causes were the arrogance and ambition of the Grecian patriarch and the Roman pontiff. The latter was constantly forming the most artful stratagems to reduce the former under his yoke; and, on the other hand, the Grecian pontiff was not only determined to refuse obstinately the least mark of submission to his haughty rival, but was also laying schemes for extending his own dominion, and for reducing all the Oriental patriarchs under his supreme jurisdiction. Among the measures to which they mutually had recoi>>e, in order to sap the foundations of each other's authority and influence with the people, were accusations of holding corrupt doctrines, or heresies, of the most dangerous nature. On the present occasion Cerularius struck the first blow, by a letter written in his own name, and in the name of Leo, bishop of Acrida, in which he publicly accused the Latins of various errors of consequence. Of such a description, among others which are enumerated by ecclesiastical historians, were their fasting on the sabbath, or seventh day of the week; their permitting the use of milk and cheese in the first week of Lent; their using unleavened bread in the celebration of the Lord's supper; their allowing their priests to be beardless , their confining themselves to one single immersion in the rite of baptism, &c. Such trifling objects as thesej in those dark times, were considered to be so serious and import.int, as to excite a fatal schism, and kindle a furious war between the Greeks and Latins, who carried their animo-: ities to the greatest lengths, and loaded each other with reciprocal invectives and imprecations. To the letter of Cerularius pope Leo IX. wrote a most imperious reply; and at the same time assembled a council at Rome, in which the Greek churches were solemnly excommunicated. In our life of that pontiff"", we have mentioned the unsuccessful issue of the effort made by the emperor Constantine Monomachus to stifle this controversy in its birth; and also the insolent and imprudent proceeding of the papal legates at Constantinople, in publicly excommunicating the patriarch, and all who should continue in his communion. Out of resentment, the patriarch excommunicated these legates with all their adherents -and followers, in a public council, and procured ark order from the emperor for burning the sentence pronounced against the Greeks. These violent measures were followed, on both sides, with a number of controversial writings, which were filled with the most bitter and irritating invectives, that contributed to widen the breach between the Greek and Latin churches^ till it became irreparable. In the year 1057, when the struggle took place between the emperor Stratioticus and Isaac Comnenus for the imperial crown, our patriarch embraced the interests of the latter, and was one of the principal instruments of raising him to that dignity. Owing either to the persuasion or menaces of Cerularius, Stratioticus divested himself of the purple, and retired into a monastery; after which Comnenus advanced to Constantinople,, where the influence of the patriarch had prepared the way for his being received without opposition, and he was crowned by that prelate on the day after his arrival. In the following year, the emperor being compelled by the exhausted state of the public treasury to lay heavy taxes upon the people, thought it reasonable to draw from the monasteries also part of the immense wealth with which tiny* had been enriched by his predecessors. This, proceeding was highly resented by the patriarch, who arrogantly threatened to pull him down from the throne 10 which he had raised him, unless he restored what he had taken from the religious houses. Exasperated at this insolent menace, the emperor caused Cerularius to be arrested, deposed, and sent into exile, where he died soon afterwards. Two of this patriarch's "" Letters,"" in Greek and Latin,, may be seen in the second volume of "" Cotelerii Eccl. Grasc. Vjonum.;"" and two of his "" Synodical ] diets,"" together with fragments of others, in Greek and Latin, are preserved in "" Jur. Grsec."" Lib. II!. and IV. and in Leo Allatius "" De Lib. Eccles.

,,Saavedra (Miguel Cervantes de),Watkins,"A celebrated Spanish writer, was born at Madrid in 1549. He appears to have had a liberal education, though of his early life little is known, but he served as a common soldier under Colonna, and left his left hand at the victory of Lepanto. After this misfortune he became chamberlain to the cardinal Aquaviva at Rome, but in 1574 he had the miffortune to be taken by a Barbary corsair, and Was carried to Algiers, where he continued in slavery above five years. At length he was ransomed by the religious society of redemption; and on his return to Spain, being in a very reduced state, he had recourse to his pen for a subsistence. He wrote a great number of dramatic pieces, which were performed with success at Madrid. But he seems to have gained more fame than fortune, for he wrote the first part of his immortal work, Don Quixote, in prison, where he was confined for debt! It was printed at Madrid in 1605, and the remainder in 1615. Though this romance was written to expose local and temporary folly, it will be read at all times and in all countries with delight. Cervantes wrote beside's this, his exemplary novels, another entitled, Persiles and Sigisirmunda, and Galatea. He died in 1617.",,,,1620.0,d.,56.0,Bel,d.

,,Charles XII.,Watkins,"Son and successor of the preceding [Charles XI. king of Sweden], was born in 1682, and from his childhood he had an ambition to imitate Alexander the great. He came to the throne at the age of fifteen, and at his coronation matched the crown from the hands of the archbishop of Upsal, and put it on his own head. His youth presented a favourable opportunity to Russia, Denmark, and Poland, to form a confederacy against him. The young hero, undaunted at this alliance, attacked each in turn, beginning with Denmark, which produced a peace with that power. In 1709 he obtained an astonishing victory over the Russians at Narva, and though his force consisted only of 8000 he attacked them in their entrenchments, slew 30,000, and took 20,000 prisoners. His next enterprise was against Poland, and after several battles he dethroned Augustus and placed Stanislaus upon the throne. Charles would have done prudently in contenting himself with the glory of these actions after the peace of 1706; but a portion of madness entered into his character and he formed the romantic resolution of humbling Peter the great. He at first obtained some signal advantages, but at length experienced a terrible defeat at Pultowa in 1709. Almost all his troops were either slain or taken prisoners; he was wounded himself in the leg, and was carried off in a litter. Charles sought an asylum in Turkey, where he was entertained by the grand seignior, who provided for him a residence at Bender, where his conduct was so violent that he was ordered to leave the Turkish territories, which he refused. On this the grand seignior directed that he should be forced away, but Charles with his retinue formed an encampment, and resisted the attack of the janizaries till superiority of numbers obliged him to take shelter in his house, which he defended with great spirit, and did not yield till fire was set to the premises. He then sallied out sword in hand, but being entangled by his long spurs he fell, and was taken prisoner. He was treated with more respect than he deserved, and after being kept as a prisoner ten months requested leave to return to his dominions, which was readily granted. His arrival diffused universal joy in his kingdom, though he found it in a wretched condition. In 1716 he invaded Norway, but after penetrating to Christiana was obliged to return to Sweden He resumed the attack in the winter of 1718, but was killed by a cannon shot at the siege of Frederickshall, December 11, aged 36 years, having reigned 21. Charles was liberal, active, and firm, but rash, obstinate, and cruel. He was never intimidated even in the midst of the greatest dangers. At the battle of Narva he had several horses shot under him, and as he was mounting upon a fresh one, he said, ""These people find me exercise."" When he was besieged at Stralsund, a bomb fell into the house while he was dictating to his secretary , who immediately drooped the pen in a fright. ""What is the matter?"" said Charles. ""Oh, the bomb!"" answered he. ""The bomb,"" says the king, ""what have we to do with the bomb? go on.""",,,,1719.0,d.,56.0,,d.

Francis I. of France disputed with him the latter title, which occasioned a violent war in 1521. Charles made a league with Henry VIII. of England, and after several imortant actions took Francis prisoner at the battle of Pavia. A peace was concluded in 1529, and Charles turned his arms against Africa, where he took Goletta, vanquished Barbarossa, entered Tunis, and reestablished Muly-Hassan on the throne. Soon after this he recommenced hostilities against France and ravaged Champagne and Picardy, but was at length obliged to retire, and peace was restored in 1538. In 1541 he attempted the conquest of Algiers, but his fleet was dispersed in a hurricane, and the emperor was obliged to return in disgrace. He then leagued with England against France, but fortune was not so favourable to him as she had formerly been, and he was glad to enter into a treaty in 1545. The protestant princes of Germany confederated against him, and obtained liberty of conscience for those of their religion. In 1556 he resigned the crown to his son Philip, and went into a monastery in Estramadura, where he employed the remainder of his days in religious exercises, mechanical pursuits, and gardening.

In 1370 he was appointed his majesty's shield-bearer, he was sent to Genoa some time after to hire ships for the king's service, and at his return obtained a grant of a pitcher of wine a day, to be delivered by the butler of England; and the place of comptroller of the customs of London, for wool, &c. In the succeeding reign he was obliged to go abroad to avoid the resentment of the clergy for having embraced the doctrines of Wickliffe. He returned privately, but was taken and committed to prison, from whence he was not released till he had made his submission. On this he retired to Woodstock, where he employed himself in correcting his works. There he published his treatise on the Astrolabe. Henry IV. in the first year of his reign gave him an annuity of forty marks for his life. He died in 1400, and was buried in Westminster abbey.

But Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, thinking the innovation was allied to heresy, prohibited any deviation from the old corruption. In 1544 Cheke became tutor to prince Edward, at whose accession he was rewarded with a pension, and a grant of lands. He was also made provost of King's cellege, and received the honour of knighthood. Queen Mary sent him to the Tower, for being concerned in the plan of raising Jane Grey to the throne.

,,Chillingworth (William),Watkins,"An eminent divine, was born at Oxford in 1602, and educated at Trinity-coliege, where he took his degrees in arts; after which he was persuaded by Fisher, the jesuit, to embrace the Romish faith. He went to Douay for that purpose, but the letters of bishop Laud, who was his godfather, made him repent of his hastiness, and he returned to England and the protestant communion in 1631. The Romanists, hurt at losing so valuable an acquisition, attacked him with great severity, which occasioned him to write his famous book, entitled, The Religion of Protestants a safe Way to Salvation; printed in 1638, in folio. The same year he was made prebendary of Salisbury, to which was afterwards added the mastership of Wigston's hospital in Leciestershire. In the civil wars he adhered to the royal cause, and was at the siege of Gloucester as an engineer, in 1643. But the same year he was taken prisoner in Arundel castle, Sussex, and conveyed to Chichester, where he died at the bishop's palace in 1644. He was buried in the cathedral of that city, by the furious zealot, Cheynel, who had attended him in his sicknes, and at the grave made a frantic speech, after throwing in the book above mentioned with all the terms of execrations his fanatical imagination could invent.",,,,1644.0,d.,56.0,D,d.

,,Jesus-Christ,Watkins,"The Saviour of the world, and Son of God; was miraculously conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary in a stable at Bethlehem, A.M. 4004. His birth was announced to shepherds by angels; and a star appeared in the east which guided the magi to Jerusalem, who inquired of Herod where the Messiah was born., as they were come to worship him. This threw the king and his court into consternation. The magi, following the direction of the star, went to Bethlehem, where they found the child, to whom they made their offerings, and being divinely warned, did not go bad; to Herod, but returned home a contrary way. Herod, full of wrath, determined on the death of the infant; but Joseph, the husband of Mary being divinely warned in a dream, fled with the child and his mother into Egypt. While they were on their journey, Herod made a horrid slaughter of all the children in Bethlehem. On the death of the tyrant, Joseph returned towards home, but finding that Archelaus reigned in the room of his father, he went to Nazareth, by which that prophecy was fulfilled which called Jesus a Nazarene. Here he dwelt with his parents, working probably at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter, till he came to the age of 33, when he commenced his public labours; and having been baptized by John the Baptist, he called a few poor, unlearned disciples, and then went about declaring the purposes of his mission, and confirming his authority by numerous miracles. The Jews were filled with astonishment at his doctrine and works, but their hearts were hardened, and instead of receiving him as the promised Messiah, they persecuted him with the utmost malignity, and attributed his miracles to diabolical agency. The sanhedrim, or council of priests, often consulted to destroy him, and at last he was betrayed into their hands in the garden of Gethsemane, by his disciple Judas Iscariot, for thirty pieces of silver. After an examination before Caiaphas the high-priest, he was remitted to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, who made several attempts to save him from the fury of the priests and people; but being charged as an enemy of Caesar if he let Jesus go, he caused him to be first scourged and then put to death. He was crucified between two malefactors on Mount Calvary, Friday, April 3, A. D. 36. His body was entombed by Joseph of Arimathea in a new sepulchre; and as Jesus had declared that he would rise again the third day, the Jews obtained a guard from Pilate to watch the tomb. But on the third day he arose, and the soldiers went and gave information to their employers, who bribed them to say that the body was stolen by his disciples. In confutation of this calumny Jesus remained six weeks among his followers, and then conducting them to Mount Olivet, ascended into heaven. The Christian religion has subsisted to the present day, uninjured by all the attacks which have been made against it. The evidences upon which it stands are irrefragable, and its doctrines are of the most exalted nature. They teach that man is a miserable creature in consequence of the fall, but that he is restored to the divine favour by the obedience, death, and mediation of Christ, who came from heaven to make an atonement for the sins of the world, and to bring that life and immortidity to light by the gospel, which had been lost by the fall of Adam. The precepts of Christianity are agreeable to its doctrinal system; tending to make men humble, virtuous, patient, and contented in this world, and to fit them for a state of endless purity.",,,,33.0,d.,56.0,,d.

He was bred to the bar, which he quitted for a religious life and lived as a hermit in a cave six years after which he returned to Antioch and was ordained. He became so famous for his eloquence, that, on the death of Neetarius, patriarch of Constantinople, he was elected his successor in 397. He built veral hospitals in that city, gave most of his income to the poor, but in his endeavours to enlarge his episcopal jurisdiction, he was involved in a dispute with Theophilus bishop of Alexandria, who gained the empress Eudoxia to his side, and the consequence was that Chrysostom was deposed in a pretended synod at Chalcedon, in 403. The patriarch was then seized by the emperor's orders, and sent into Bithynia, which occasioned an insurrection at Constantinople; and to appease the people Chrysostom, was restored in triumph. But he was once more sent into exile for opposing the empress in placing her statue near the church, and died at Pityus, on the Euxine Sea, in 407.

This performance brought him into notice, and in 1730 he printed tracts on theological subjects, in 4to. which excited attention at the time. This work was followed by several others, in which Chubb made a regular progress towards deism; the principal of these are  ""The true Gospel of Jesus Christ asserted;"" ""An Inquiry into the Ground and Foundation of Religion;"" and ""Four Dissertations on Subjects in the Old Testament."" He lived some time with sir Joseph Jekyll, where however, he was occasionally required to wait at table as a servant out of livery.

,,Cicero (Marcus Tullius),Watkins,"An illustrious Roman prator and philosopher, was born at Arpim/m, B. C. 105. He was honourably descended both by his father and mother's side, and his education was answerable to his birth and expectations. He was taught philosophy by Philo, and law by Mutius Sccevola; and military knowlege he acquired under Sylla, in the Marsian war. When young he translated the Greek poem of A rains on the celestial phenomena into Latin, of which some fragments remain. At the age of 26 he appeared at the bar, and pleaded the cause of P. Quintilius, and defended Roscius of Ameria in such a manner as charmed the Romans. Soon afterwards he traveled into Greece and Asia, and spent some time at Athens with his friend T. Pomponius Atticus. On his return to Rome he became distinguished above all the pleaders; and his conduct in Sicily, whither he was sent as quaestor, procured him the applause of the inhabitants of that island. After passing through the offices of aedile and prxtor, he offered himself candidate for the consulship; and though powerfully opposed, he succeeded, and had for his associate C. Antony. One of his competitors was the famous Catiline, who formed the design of murdering him, but the conspiracy being discovered, and Catiline accused to the senate, he quitted the city and raised an army in Gaul, which was defeated by C. Antony. The conspirators at Rome were put to death by Cicero, who was called by the citizens, ""the father of his country, and the second founder of the republic."" His vehemence against Clodius, who was accused of having violated the mysteries of the Bcna Dt/r, brought upon him a train of evils; and when Clodius became tribune he undermined his enemy so effectually, that Cicero found it expedient to go into voluntary exile. His banishment did not last long, for the Clodian faction became so odious that the senate and people unanimously recalLed him. In the disputes between Ciesar and Pompey he sided with the latter, and followed him into Greece; but after the battle of Pharsalia he returned into Italy, and obtained the friendship of Caesar. He now led a retired life, and left political ""contentions for literary amusements. But when Caesar was slain he came once more upon the public stage, and advised the senate to grant a general amnesty. When Antony began to get the ascendency, Cicero, knowing that he was hated by him, removed to Athens . from whence, however, he soon returned, though he lived in the constant expectation erf being assassinated. Augustus at first courted his friendship, and affected a wish to be guided by his counsels; but this was all artifice, and when he joined Antony and formed the triumvirate, he readily sacrificed this great man to the resentment of Antony. Cicero was at Tusculum when he received the news of the proscription in which he was included, and immediately set out in a litter for the seacoast, to avoid his enemies. But he was overtaken by Popilius Lamas, a tribune, whose life he had formerly saved by his eloquence. When the assassins came up he stretched his head out of the litter, and was beheaded. Popilius carried the head and hands in triumph to Antony, who had the baseness to place them on the rostra, where Cicero had so often defended the lives, fortunes, and liberties of the Roman people. This happened, B. C. 42. The talents of this great man have been the subject of universal admiration, and his virtues were also eminent, both public and private, but they were in some degree obscured by excessive vanity. The best editions of hi3 works are those of Oxford, in 10 vols. 4to. 1782; Geneva, by Olivet, in 9 vois. 4to. 1758; and Paris, by Barbou, 14 vols; 1768. Cicero married Terentia, whom he afterwards divorced, and by whom he had a son and a daughter. His second wife was a young woman to whom he was guardian. His son Marcus served under Pompey, with great reputation, and Augustus made him augur; but his conduct was licentious, and Pliny says that he was the greatest drunkard in the empire.",,,,-43.0,d.,57.0,,d.

On the accession of Sancho, he accompanied him to the seige of Zamora, where the king being killed by treachery, Roderigo led the troops back to Castile, carrying with him the dead body of his master. Alfonso, the brother of Sancho, was then placed on the throne, after purging himself by oath from all concern in the murder of Sancho. In 1074 Roderigo married donna Ximena Dias, daughter of count Diego Alvarez of the Asturias; soon after which, he revolted against Alfonso, and committed great ravages throughout Arragon, and penetrating near Saragossa, fixed his residence in a fortress still called Pena de el Cid (the rock of the Cid), where he became an independant chief.

,,Hyde (Edward),Watkins,"Earl of Clarendon, and lord chancellor of England, was born at Dinton in Wiltshire, of an ancient family, in 1608. In 1622 he was admitted of Magdalen hall, Oxford, from whence he removed to the Middle Temple. In 1640 he was chosen member of parliament for Wotton-Basset, and distinguished himself by his moderation and firm regard to the constitution. He sat in the long parliament for Saltash, and was appointed to carry up a charge to the lords against the judges Davenport, Weston, and Trevor, on which occasion he made an admirable speech. He was also employed to draw up the articles of impeachment against the earl of Strafford, but disapproving the measures pursued, he left the party, opposed the bill of attainder, and when the commons passed an ordinance for raising the militia against the king, he considered it as an act of rebellion, and went to his majesty at York. In 1642 he received the honour of knighthood and the chancellorship of the exchequer. In 1644 he was appointed one of the king's commissioners at the treaty of Uxbridge. When the royal cause was ruined, he went to Jersey, and from thence to Paris. In 1649 the exiled king sent him with lord Cottingron to the court of Madrid. In 1657 he was made chancellor, which post was continued to him at the Restoration, when he was likewise chosen chancellor of the university of Oxford. He was also created a peer, and in 1661 earl of Clarendon. He conducted himself in his high station with great wisdom, moderation, and virtue; but his inflexible integrity procured him many powerful enemies in that dissolute court. The marriage of the duke of York with his daughter was made use of by them to alienate the king's regard from him, but ineffectually. In 1663 the earl of Bristol exhibited charges against him in the house of lords, but they were proved frivolous. The building, however, of Clarendon-house, which was considered as too superb for a subject, and the intrigues of a corrupt cabal succeeded, and in 1667 he was deprived of his place. He was also impeached of treason and other misdemeanors, on which he withdrew secretly to France; and as soon as his flight was known an act of banishment was passed against him. In 1668, while he was at Evreux, confined to his bed, a party of English seamen broke into his chamber, and dragged him into the yard, where they were about to dispatch him, when their lieutenant arrived and disarmed them. He died at Rouen in 1673, and his remains were brought to England, and interred in Westminster abbey.

,,Clarke (Samuel),Watkins,"A learned divine, was born in 1675, at Norwich, of which city his father was alderman, and member of parliament. He received his education at the grammar school of Norwich, from whence he went to Caius college, Cambridge. Rohault's Physics was then the text book in natural philosophy at Cambridge; this Mr. Clarke translated into better Latin, with Notes, agreeable to the Newtonian system, at the age of twentytwo. When ordained, he became chaplain to bishop Moore of Norwich, wlto gave him the rectory of Draycot, in Norfolk. In 1701 he published his Paraphrase of the Gospel of St. Matthew, which was afterwards extended to the remaining Gospels. In 1704 he preached the Boyle's lecture, and gave such satisfaction that he was appointed to preach the year following. In 1706 he printed a letter to Dodwell on the Immortality of the Soul, a philosophical and learned discourse. This controversy lasted for some time. The same year appeared his Latin translation of Newton's Optics, for which sir Isaac complimented him with 500/. About this time he was presented to the rectory of St. Bennet's, Paul's Wharf, London, and appointed chaplain to queen Anne. In 1709 he obtained the rectory of St. James's, Westminster, and took his degree of D.D. at Cambridge. In 1712 he published an elegant edition of Caesar's Commentaries, and the same year his celebrated book, entitled The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity, which made a great noise, and was not only written against by numerous writers, but complained of by the lower house of convocation. In 1715, and the following year, he had a dispute with Leibnitz, on the principles of natural philosophy and religion. In 1717 he printed remarks upon Collin's Enquiry concerning Human Liberty. About a year afterwards he made an innovation in the doxology in the singing Psalms according to the arian doctrine, which gave such offence to doctor Robinson, bishop of London, that he sent a circular letter to his clergy, warning them against the use of these forms. At this time Dr. Clarke was presented to the mastership of Wigston's hospital, in Leicester. In 1724 he published seventeen sermons, preached on several occasions. In 1727 he was offered the place of master of the mint, vacant by the death of sir Isaac Newton, but refused it. In 1729 he published the first twelve books of Homer's Iliad, with a Latin version and annotations. The remaining books were published by his son in 1732. This great man was seized with a pain in his side, Sunday, May 11, 1729, as he was going to preach before the judges at Serjeant's inn and being rendered incapable of discharging the duty, he was carried home, and died the Saturday following. The same year appeared his Exposition of the Church Catechism, and 10 volumes of his sermons. Dr. Clarke was a profound Scholar, a close reasoner, an acute critic; well versed in mathematics, philosophy, and metaphysics. He was also a man of unaffected manners; mild, amiable and charitable to those who differed from him.",,,,1729.0,d.,57.0,D,d.

On contracting an acquaintance with Dr. Clarke in London, he embraced arianism; notwithstanding which, he accepted preferment in the church of Ireland, and was successively promoted to the sees of Killala, Cork, and Clogher; to the last of which he was translated in 1745. His first performance was an Introduction to the History of the Jews, which was followed by the Chronology of the Hebrew Bible vindicated, 1747, 4to.; a Dissertation on Prophecy, in 1749; and, an impartial Enquiry into the Time of the Coming of the Messiah, 8vo. In 1751 he attracted considerable notice by a dedication to a piece entitled an Essay on Spirit, in which the doctrine of the Trinity was controverted. The Essay was attributed to the bishop, but he was only the author of the preliminary discourse. After this he published a Vindication of the Histories of the Old and New Testament, against Bolingbroke. In 1756 he made a motion in the house of lords for expunging the Athanasian and Nicene creeds from the liturgy, but it was not seconded. In consequence of this and some other attempts to overturn the orthodox faith, a mandate was sent from the king for a prosecution to be commenced against the bishop, which had such an effect on his spirits that he died of a nervous fever in 1758.",,,,1758.0,d.,41.0,D,d.,,,100,Clayton,Clayton,1.0,Divines and Metaphysicians &cc,Great Britain,99.0,male,600.0,D,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Clayton_(bishop),1713.0,1758.0,case2

,,Columbus (Christopher),Watkins,"A celebrated navigator, was born at Genoa about 1447. His origin was humble, and it is asserted that he was bred to his father's business, of a weaver, but quitted it for the sea. After making some trading voyages in the Mediterranean, he engaged in the service of a corsair, but the ship was blown up in an engagement, and he saved himself by swimming. He then went to Lisbon, where his brother Bartholomew was settled as a maker of charts. Here Christopher married the daughter of a naval commander, who had been employed in voyages of discovery. From his father-in-law's journals and charts he acquired a considerable share of nautical knowledge, and traded several years to the Canary islands and the coast of Africa. By application to the study of cosmography he began to entertain the idea, that there must be a new continent beyond the Atlantic ocean. The more he considered this subject he became confirmed in the persuasion, and after corresponding with a learned Florentine, named Paul Foscanelli, famous for his geographical skill, he communicated his plan to the republic of Genoa, but his proposals were rejected as extravagant. He next applied to John II. king of Portugal, but without success. He then sent his brother Bartholomew to Henry VII. of England, but on the voyage he was taken by pirates. In the mean time Columbus obtained an audience of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, who received him favourably, and in 1492 granted him three vessels to prosecute discoveries. The conditions stipulated between him and his royal employers were, ""that if he made no discoveries he should have no reward; that if he did he should be viceroy by land, and admiral by sea, and have the tenths of the profits of all the countries discovered by him, and that these privileges should descend to his family."" August 2d of that year, Columbus and his little squadron launched into the deep and touched at the Canaries on the 11th, from whence they sailed the 6th of September. When they were out of sight of land the crews began to be uneasy, and it required no ordinary share of prudence to prevent them from breaking into mutiny. Columbus, however, succeeded in stilling the fears and keeping alive the hopes of his men, and on the 11th of October he perceived a light from his cabin. The next morning he landed in Guana bay, and erected the royal standard. This island, which is one of the Luccas or Bahamas, he called St. Salvador. From hence he sailed to Cuba, and afterwards to Hispaniola. Having discovered other islands, and taken possession in the name of their catholic majesties, Columbus returned to Europe, bringing with him some of the natives. January 24th he arrived at Lisbon, and was well received by the king of Portugal, who however, seemed to think that the conquests appertained to him, as Columbus had been in his service. Columbus replied, ""that he knew of no such agreement, and had carefully abstained from visiting any of the Portuguese settlements."" The king was satisfied, and would have sent him to Spain over-land, but the admiral chose rather to go with his ships. On the 15th of March he arrived at Seville, and immediately went to Barcelona to their majesties, who received him under a canopy of cloth of gold, made him sit beside them, and conferred on him several marks of favour. Having obtained letters patent, a larger fleet was fitted out under his command, and people were sent out to colonize Hispaniola. Columbus sailed from Cadiz Sept. 25, 1493, and in this voyage visited the islands of Dominica, St. Mary's, Guadaloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, Hispaniola, Cuba, and Jamaica. In his voyage home his men suffered much from want of provisions and sickness, and a difference among the pilots occasioned much disaffection. But Columbus preserved his temper, and by admirable prudence maintained order among his crews. In this voyage he confirmed the result of former observations on the variation of the compass. In 1498 he made a third voyage, in which he discovered the island of Trinidad, and on his arrival at Hispaniola found the colony in a state bordering on a civil war. He succeeded in restoring peace, but some of the settlers, out of envy against him and his brother Bartholomew, whom he had left there as his lieutenant, sent home such accusations, that queen Isabella revoked the appointment of Columbus and appointed Francis de Bovadilla governor in his room. This man, on his arrival, caused the brothers to be ironed, and in that condition sent them to Europe. The captain of the ship would have taken off the fetters, but Columbus refused to be liberated except in the presence of his sovereigns. All Spain felt with indignation the insult offered to so great a man. He was instantly set at liberty, and rewarded with a considerable grant. Columbus, however, always kept the fetters, and ordered that they should be buried with him. In 1502 he made another voyage, in which he traced the coast of Darien, thinking to find a passage to the East Indies. He returned to Spain in 1504, and found queen Isabella dead, and the king prejudiced against him. This great man died at Valladolid, in 1506. His remains were interred in the cathedral of Seville, where a monument was erected to his memory, bearing this inscription: ""To Castile and Leon Columbus has given a new world."" Yet this brave adventurer had not the honour of giving his name to the world he discovered, but was robbed of it by Amerigo, or Americus Vesputius, a Florentine. Of Columbus's singular sagacity and prudence the following anecdote is related. While he lay off Hispaniola, the Indians neglected to bring him the provisions which he had agreed for: on this Columbus sent for the chiefs, and told them that the God of the Christians was angry at their breach of faith, and as a proof of it, the ensuing night the moon would rise with a threatening and bloody aspect. He knew that there would be an eclipse that night, but the Indians made light of the prediction, till they saw it verified, on which, in great agony, they supplicated his forgiveness, and ever after continued to bring in the stipulated supplies. Bartholomew Columbus died in 1514. Diego, the son of Christopher, was ennobled and obtained his father's honours and grants. Ferdinand , another son, embraced the ecclesiastical state, and formed a rich library, which he left to the cathedral of Seville. He wrote the life of his father, and died about 1530",,,,1506.0,d.,58.0,,d.

,,"Peter, surnamed Commestor, or the Eater",Aikin,"another eminent French ecclesiastic in die I2th century, was a native of Troyes in Champagne. Having embraced the clerical profession, he became canon, and afterwards dean, of the cathedral in that city. In this situation he acquired such celebrity, that he was invited to Paris, where he was appointed dean of the metropolitan church. Some time after this he resigned his benefices, renounced the world, nnd entered among the canonsregular of St. Victor at Paris, where he gave himself up wholly to study and exercises of devotion. He died in the year i 198. He was a man of learning for the age in which he lived, and, what reflects credit on his memory, had the hardihood publicly to condemn some of the abuses and corruptions of the Romish church. This we learn from the testimony of Girald Larry, more generally known by the name of Giraldus Cambrensis, who was his disciple, and most probably imbibed from him the enmity which on all occasions he discovered against the monks. In a manuscript of that author preserved in the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth, he tells us that he heard Peter declare before his whole school, in which many persons of distinguished literature were present, that the old enemy, meaning the devil, never insidiously devised a more injurious measure against the church of God, than the law which enjoined a vow of celibacy on the clergy. The following epitaph upon his tomb has been thought not unworthy of preservation, by different authors who have communicated notices of him to the public : Petrus eram, quern Petra tegit, dictusque Coincstor.

At the age of 22 he gained the battle of Rocroi against the Spaniards, which victory was followed by the capture of Thionville, and other places. He next entered Germany, where he gathered innumerable laurels. Being recalled from thence, he was sent into Catalonia, but failed in his attempt to take Lerida. In 1641 he defeated the Imperialists in Flanders with prodigious slaughter. In the civil war, occasioned by the maladministration of Cardinal Mazarine, and the conduct of the queen mother, Conde adhered to the court, and effected a reconciliation. He afterwards joined the malcontents, in consequence of the ungrateful treatment he experienced from the cardinal, and in 1652 a civil war broke out, in which Conde opposed the court, but without success. Peace was concluded, but the prince refusing to accede to it, entered into the service of the Spaniards in the Low Countries; and though his military exploits were uncommonly splendid in this new region, yet the circumstance of his joining the enemies of his country is a stain on his memory. At the peace of the Pyrennees, in 1659, he obtained his pardon, and he served his country with his wonted activity and success. He contended with the prince of Orange in the Netherlands, and was wounded at the famous passage of the Rhine. The conquest of Franche Compte was also chiefly owing to him.

,,Confucius or Cong-fu-tse,Watkins,"A Chinese philosopher, was born in the province of Chan-Iong, about 551 years B. C. Wonderful things are told of the precocity of his talents, and of his extraordinary virtue, particularly his dutifulness to his ancestors, a point of the highest consequence in the moral system of the Chinese. He lost his father, who was a mandarin, at the age of three years; but his grandfather, a learned and holy man, lived long enough to impart his instructions to his grandson. When he was nineteen he took a wife, by whom he had a son, who died at the age of 50, and left a son called Tson-tse, whose character stood high for wisdom and virtue. Confucius never kept any concubines, though it was the custom of his country. At the age of 23 he formed the project of a general reformation, and with success, being equally respected by king and people. A great change was brought about in the kingdom of Lu, where he lived, which alarmed the neighbouring princes, who sent the king several tempting girls to allure him from virtue and Confucius. The scheme succeeded, and the philosopher withdrew from court in disgust, he then travelled in search of a country disposed to attend to his maxims. He went through several countries spreading his doctrines, and endeavouring to make men wise and happy. His followers became numerous; out of whom he selected ten as his chosen disciples, to whom he imparted the treasures of wisdom. He died in the 73d year of his age. The king of Lu, when he heard of his death, burst into tears, and said, ""that heaven being displeased with him, had taken away Confucius."" From that time his memory was cherished as that of a saint, and several magnificent structures were raised to his honour. His books are regarded by the Chinese as the fountain of wisdom, and they appear to deserve the praise bestowed upon them, as far as they regard pure morality.

About this time he was engaged in a controversy with Collier respecting the immorality of his pieces, in which Congreve was completely foiled. He died in 1729.

,,Constantine the great,Watkins,"Emperor of the Romans was the son of Constantine Chlorus, by Helena, and born about the year 274. On the death of his father, in 306, he was proclaimed emperor by the army. He defeated the Franks, after which he crossed the Rhine and committed great ravages in Belgium. He married Fausta, the daughter of Maximum, in 307. His father-in-law taking advantage of his absence from Arles, where he held his court, seized the treasury and assumed the imperial title, but shortly after he was taken prisoner by Constantine, and strangled himself. A war now broke out between Constantine and Maxentius, the son of Maximian, on which the former marched into Italy, which he completely reduced, and in a battle near Rome, Maxentius was defeated and drowned in the Tiber. It is at this period that the tera of Constantine's conversion to Christianity by the supernatural appearance of a luminous cross in the heavens is fixed. But though the emperor himself related the circumstance to Eusebius, it stands on a weak foundation. After the death of Maxentius, he entered Rome in triumph, and received from the senate the rank of Augustus, in conjunction with Licinius and Maxintin, the former ol whom married his sister, Constantia. A civil war shortly after broke out between Licinius and Maximin, in which the latter was slain, licinius then formed a conspiracy against Constantine, which being discovered, war ensued between them, in which Constantine was successful, and peace was concluded. A second war broke out in 323, and terminated the defeat of Licinius, and his resignation of the Imperial dignity. Not long afterwards he was strangled. Having obtained possession of the empire, Constantine began to shew his regard for the religion which he had adopted, by building numerous churches, and taking a journey to Jerusalem to visit the holy sepulchre. While in the Holy Land he erected a magnificent church at Bethlehem. At this time the Christian world was disturbed by the disputes between the orthodox and the arians. At the head of the first stood Athanasius, to whom Constantine shewed but little favour, and consented to his banishment; but afterwards he condemned the doctrines of Arms, and adhered to the Nicene confession. With this zeal for religion he blended courage and justice. He conquered the Goths, and gave an asylum in his dominions to a number of Samaritans who had been driven from their own country.

About 1578, he was chosen reader at Lyons inn. Soon after his admission at the bar he married a lady of fortune, who brought him ten children. In 1502 he was appointed solicitor-general; and, on losing his wife, he married, in 1598, the widow of sir Christopher Hatton and sister of Thomas lord Burleigh, afterwards earl of Exeter. In 1600 he prosecuted, as attorneygeneral, the earl of Essex, in which he behaved with uncommon asperity. Three years afterwards he received the honour of knighthood; and conducted the prosecution of sir Walter Raleigh, in a brutal manner. His speeches at the trial of father Garnett, and the other conspirators in the gunpowder plot, are deemed his masterpieces in that way. In 1606 he was appointed chief justice of the common-pleas; and in 1613 removed to the king's-bench, at which time he was sworn of the privy council. In the affair of sir Thomas Overbury's murder, he conducted himself with such spirit as to raise him many enemies, and soon afterwards he fell into disgrace for opposing the king's prerogative, and contending with the chancellor Egerton. In 1616 he was removed from his office, and to get into favour he projected a match between sir John Villiers, brother of the favourite, and his youngest daughter, which occasioned a quarrel between him and his wife. The lady left his house with her daughter, and sir Edward fetched back the latter by force, which occasioned his wife to complain of him to the privy-council. The affair was at last made up, and the marriage concluded. In the parliament of 1621 he joined the popular side; for which he was committed to the Tower, where he lay only a short time, but never recovered the good opinion of king James. In 1628 he was chosen knight of the shire for Buckingham, and distinguished himself by his zeal against the duke of Buckingham as the author of all the calamities of the nation. On the dissolution of that parliament he retired to his seat in Buckinghamshire, where he died in 1634. The first part of his reports appeared about 1600, and the last, or thirteenth, about 1655.

,,Cortes (Ferdinand),Watkins,"A celebrated Spanish adventurer, was born in Estremadura, in 1485. His family was respectable but not opulent, and he was bred at Salamanca to the law, which he renounced for the military life. The governor of Hispaniola was his relation; and Cortes in 1504 went to St. Domingo, where he was appointed to several valuable posts. In 1511 he accompanied Velasquez in his expedition to Cuba, and displayed so much skill and bravery as to be rewarded with the grant of a quantity of land. The conquest of Mexico being resolved upon, Cortes was chosen to conduct the enterprise, and he embraced it with ardour. He left Cuba on this great design in 1519, with a fleet of eleven small vessels, and 617 men, soldiers and sailors. Thirteen soldiers only were armed with firelocks, but they had ten small field-pieces, and sixteen horses; such was the army for the conquest of an extensive and populous empire. The Spaniards first landed at Tabasco, where, after several bloody battles, they compelled the natives to submit to their yoke. From thence they sailed to St. Juan de Ulva, in the bay of Mexico, where Cortes was met by several messengers from the governors of the province; but he assumed to himself the title ambassador of the king of Castile and insisted on being introduced to Montezuma, the emperor, for which purpose he intended to march to the capital. The governors, alarmed, endeavoured to dissuade him from this purpose, but sent by the emperor only served to inflame the avarice of the Spaniards still more. After several negotiations, Montezuma perceiving their treacherous designs broke off all intercourse with them. Cortes in the mean time had erected a setlement on the coast, to which was given the name of Vera Cruz. Here he formed a civil government, and declared himself independent of the governor of Cuba. The Zempoallans and other tribes of Indians being dissatisfied with the government of Montezuma, courted an alliance with the strangers. Thus strengthened, Cortes destroyed his ships, thereby compelling his men to exercise their fortitude and valour, as well as confidence in the skill and courage of their leader. At the head of five hundred Spaniards indifferently armed, with fifteen horses, Cortes marched up the country, where he was opposed by the Tlascalans a warlike nation, who were the enemies of Montezuma, but resolved to defend their country against these invaders. After several battles, in which the Spaniards met with no loss, peace was concluded, by which the Tlascalans acknowledged themselves vassals to Spain. Cortes, flushed with this success, proceeded to Cholula, in the Mexican empire, where he was received with hospitality, which he rewarded by massacring the inhabitants. From thence the Spaniards pushed on to Mexico, and at the gates were met by Montezuma himself splendidly arrayed, who gave them an amicable reception. Soon after, Cortes adopted the plan of seizing the emperor, and actually carried it into effect. For five months Montezuma was kept prisoner in his capital by a handful of men, who compelled him to acknowledge himself a vassal of the king of Castile. While Cortes was at Mexico, Velasquez sent out an armament under Narvaez, with orders to send him prisoner to Cuba. When Cortes heard that Narvaez was landed he left a small force under Alvarado, to take charge of the emperor and hastened to Vera Cruz, where, by a stratagem, he took the army sent against prisoners. By his lenient conduct on this occasion he prevailed upon these men to enter into his service, and thus acquired a great accession of strength. During his absence from Mexico, Alvarado massacred a number of Mexicans, at a religious festival, which occasioned hostilities, and several of the Spaniards were killed. Cortes hastened to his old quarters, and the war raged with the greatest fury. Though the artillery swept off prodigidus numbers, the Mexicans attacked the Spaniards with so much fury, that Cortes began to be alarmed, and caused the emperor in his royal robes to appear upon the battlements in hopes that the assailants, out of reverence to their monarch, would yield or retire. But this sight served the more to encourage them, and they renewed the attack with additional fury, in which Montezuma received a mortal wound. In the night Cortes retreated from Mexico, but the Mexicans sallied after the Spaniards and commited a dreadful slaughter. Reduced to half his men, and having lost most of his baggage, Cortes retreated to Tlascala, but by the way met with a prodigious army, which he charged with impetuosity, and completely routed. This is called the battle of Otumba. The disasters he had experienced did not damp the ardent spirit of Cortes, who, having collected 550 infantry and forty horse, with a large body of Tlascalans, began his march towards Mexico in December 1520. Montezuma was succeeded by Guatimozin, his son-in-law, a brave young prince, who made every preparation against the expected return of the Spaniards. After taking Texuco, the second city of the empire, Cortes sat down before Mexico, and proceeded by a regular siege; during which, he received a considerable reinforcement from Vera Cruz. The Mexicans were driven to a hopeless stat, and Guatimozin was taken in a canoe, in the act of making an escape. On this the capital surrendered, and the empire of Mexico ended. Though the plunder was immense, the avarice of the Spaniards was not satisfied, and Cortes put the unhappy Emperor to the torture, to make him confess where he had concealed his treasures. Guatimozin, however, endured his sufferings with fortitude, and nothing could wrest from him a complaint or a discovery. He was afterwards, hung with two of his officers on a pretended charge of conspiracy. While Cortes was thus engaged, a commision came from Spain to deprive him of his command, but this he contrived to elude, and afterwards obtained from Charles V. the appointment of govenor of New Spain. His conduct to the natives was infamous and in one execution he committed sixty caciques and 400 other principal persons to the flames. A new commision at last arrived against him, on which he returned to Spain to vidicate himself in 1528. Having made his defence to the stisfaction of Charles, he was created a marquis, and obtained a large grant of land in New Spain, whither he made a new voyage in 1530. He returned to his own country in 1540, and died in 1547, leaving several legitimate children, and some by his two Indian mistresses, Marina, and a daughter of Montezuma.",,,,1554.0,d.,59.0,,d.

,,Cranmer (Thomas),Watkins,"Archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Aslacton, in Nottinghamshire, in 1489, and educated at Jesus college, Cambridge, where he proceeded to the degree of D.D. The opinion which he gave on the question of Henry VIIIth's divorce recommended him to that monarch, who employed him to vindicate the measure, and sent him to the foreign universities to obtain their opinion upon the point. At Rome he presented his book on the divorce to the pope, and offered to justify it in a public disputation, but none was appointed. In Germany he married a niece of Osiander: and during his abode there, archbishop Warham died, on which the king nominated Cranmer to that dignity, which he endeavoured to decline. In 1533 he was consecrated, and though he received the customary bulls from the pope, he protested against submission to his authority. The first service in which he was employed was to pronounce the divorce between the king and Catherine. He furthered the Reformation with zeal, tempered with judgment and moderation. That valuable work, the Erudition of a Christian Man, was set forth by him, and by his means the Bible was translated and read in churches. Though he was esteemed by the king for his piety and integrity,' he occasionally offended him by his opposition to the six bloody articles, and to the alienation of the abbey lands to secular uses. The archbishop wished to appropriate them to the advancement of learning and religion. Bishop Gardiner, and others, accused him to the privy council of heresy and faction, and after being ignominiously suffered to remain among the footmen for some time, he was called in, and the lords were about to send him to the Tower, when the archbishop confounded them, by producing the king's own ring, given him for that purpose. By Henry's wall he was appointed one of the regency, and as Edward VI. was brought up chiefly under the archbishop's care, the Reformation in his reign assumed a consistent form; the liturgy, homilies, and articles of religion, were framed; in all of which Cranmer had a principal hand. He also published an excellent work, entitled, ""The true and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ."" When Edward was prevailed on to alter the succession in favour of lady Jane Grey, the archbishop opposed it for a considerable time, and it was not till the judges had given their opinion in favour of its legality, that he subscribed his name, with the other members of the council, to the deed. On the accession of Mary, our prelate was ondemned first for treason, and pardoned; but another charge was brought against him of heresy, and he was sent to the Tower, from whence, with Fridley and Latimer, he was removed to Oxford, to hold a public disputation. This was a solemn mockery, for the fate of these holy men was already fixed. The archbishop was tried by the pope's commissioners, and convicted, after which he was degraded by Bonner and Thirlby with insolent rudeness. He was kept in prison three years, and after the most rigoroius measures had been made use of to prevail upon him to abjure his errors, more lenient ones were adopted. These were again changed, and he was removed to a filthy prison, where be suffered such uncommon hardships, that he was induced to sign the instrument of abjuration on the promise of life. But this was an act of treachery, to procure the papists a momentary triumph, which turned to their own disgrace. The archbishop was brought into St. Mary's church to read his recantation in public, where, after a long sermon preached by Dr. Cole, a noted persecutor of that reign, Cranmer, instead of doing what was required, with many tears beseeched God's forgiveness For the apostacy of which he had been guilty, and exhorted the people against the errors of Rome. This greatly enraged his adversaries; who, after vilifying him as a hypocrite and heretic, dragged him to the stake, opposite Balliol college, which he approached with a cheerful countenance, and endured the fire with patience and fortitude, holding his hand in the flame, and often exclaiming, ""This unworthy hand!"" and raising his eyes to heaven, expired with the dying prayer of the first martyr of the Christian church, ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,"" March 21, 1555. He was a man of great learning, deeply read in the canon law, of unimpeachable integrity, and of so meek and generous a temper, that it was a common saying, ""Do my lord of Canterbury an ill turn, and he will be your friend ever after.""",,,,1556.0,d.,59.0,D,d.

On his return to England, he was taken into the service of cardinal Wolsey, who obtained him a seat in the house of commons, where be defended his master with great spirit. On the fall of the cardinal, the king took Cromwell into his service, and gave him several important places. He was very instrumental in the dissolution of the monasteries, and greatly promoted the Reformation. For these services he obtained the title of earl of Essex, with many manors and estates, chiefly the spoils of the church. At length his affairs took an adverse turn. He had the imprudence to advise the marriage of the king with Anne of Cleves, which not proving agreeable to the tyrant, he wreaked his vengeance on the adviser of the marriage, and caused him to be tried for high treason and heresy. To be so accused was certain death; and he accordingly suffered decapitation on Tower-hill in 1540.

,,Cromwell (Oliver),Watkins,"A character of considerable note in the English history, was born of a good family at Huntingdon, in 1599, and educated first at the grammar school in that town, and then at Sidney college, Cambridge, where his conduct was very dissipated. From the university he removed to Lincoln's inn, where he addicted himself to gaming and pleasure. At the age of 21 he married Elizabeth, daughter of sir James Bouchier of Essex, and about the same time turned puritan. That this change was merely hypocritical appears from an attempt of his to get into his hands the estate of his maternal uncle sir Thomas Stuart, by soliciting a commission of lunacy against him. The project, however, failed; and though sir Thomas was justly provoked at such infamous conduct, he left his nephew, at his death, an estate of about 500/. a year. In 1625 he was elected into parliment, and in that which met in 1628, where he distinguished himself by his zeal against the bishops. When the parliament was dissolved, he retired into the country, and took a farm, which did not answer. His circumstances becoming indifferent, he resolved to go to New England, from the execution of which he was prevented by a proclamation restraining those migrations. Afterwards he removed to Ely, where he acquired celebrity by his gifts in prayer and preaching. In 1640 he was returned to parliament for the borough of Cambridge by the puritan interest. in the house he was a frequent speaker, vulgar and vehement, always opposing the court, and attacking the church. He was in a great measure the cause of the war, as he was continually by his plots and contrivances urging matters to that extremity. In 1642, when parliament determined upon hostilities, Cromwell went to Cambridge, where he raised his troop of horse, and behaved with great inhumanity to the loyal members of the university. He soon acquired the rank of colonel, and a great reputation for military skill and valour. His men were well disciplined, and animated with a strong portion or religious fanaticism, which their commander encouraged in such a manner that they acquired at the battle of Marston Moor, in 1644, the name of Ironsides. At the second battle of Newbury, Cromwell's behaviour obtained for him from his party the title of Saviour of the Nation. This party consisted of the independents, who had gained so great an influence in parliament as to pass the famous self-denying ordinance, by which all members of either house were excluded from commands in the army, with the particular exception of Cromwell, who, by this masterpiece of policy, acquired an ascendancy over the army, and thus paved the way for his future advancement. He was now constituted lieutenant-general, and by his Management the battle of Naseby was gained in 1645, which decided the fate of the royalists. This victory was followed by a series of successes, for which he was voted a pension of 2500/. per annum, and the thanks of the house. When the king was betrayed by the Scotch to the parliament, Cromwell determined to get him into his own power. This he effected by means of likely to be gained over to his purpose. The share he had in the murder of the king is too plain to need detail. He acted in it with his wonted hypocrisy, was present at the trial, and signed the warrant of execution. Soon after this a mutiny broke out in the army, which threatened dangerous consequences; but Cromwell, by punishing the ringleaders, put an end to it. In 1649 he went to Ireland, which he subdued, and, leaving Ireton as deputy, returned to England in 1650; but his cruelties are regarded with horror and detestation in that kingdom to this day. He was now appointed commander-in-chief against the Scots, who had armed to restore Charles II. September 3, 1650, he gained the battle of Dunbar; and that day twelvemonth he defeated the king at Worcester. From this time he kept his eye on the sovereign power. He began this favourite project bymoulding the army to his will; and having a party subservient to his wishes, he struck a bold stroke by dismissing the parliament and locking the door of the bouse. He then dissolved the council of state; after which, he called a council, composed of his officers. He next convened a mock representation of the nation, consisting of 142 persons, called, from one of the members, Barebones parliament. This assemblage being a motley crew of ignorant fanatics, and the creatures of Cromwell, agreed to resign their authority; on which the council of officers assembled, and drew up an instrument declaring him protector of the commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland; accordingly, Dec. 16, 1653, he was invested with this dignity in the court of chancery. The following year he called a parliament, but finding that the members began with questioning his authority, he placed a guard at their door, and then made each member as he entered take an oath of allegiance to him. This parliament still continuing refractory, he dissolved them after sitting five months. A war broke out between England and Spain in 1655, in which Jamaica was taken, and Blake gained several splendid victories, and caused the English flag to be respected in the Mediterranean. One consequence was an alliance between the protector and France, and the delivery of Dunkirk to England, after its being taken by the united forces of the two countries. In 1656 he called another parliament, which gratified the protector by confirming his title and sanctioning his proceedings. He wanted now the title of king, but this was rejected by his most zealous friends; and finding the object unattainable, he abandoned it. However, he had the privilege granted him to make a sort of lords; and the title of protector being recognized, he was inaugurated with the pomp of a coronation in Westminsterhall. In 1658 he convened the two houses, and addressed them in the language usual for the king's of England; but none of the hereditary nobles would attend his mock parliament. Finding that he could not form any thing like a regular establishment, he dissolved the assembly. In August of that year his favourite daughter, Mrs. Claypole, died, bitterly reproaching him for his conduct, which, with the publication of a pamphlet, by colonel Titus, entitled Killing no Murder, tending to prove the assassination of the tyrant a public duty, produced a slow fever, of which he died September 3, 1658. His corpse was interred in Henry VIIth's chapel, from whence at the Restoration it was taken and exposed on, and afterwards buried under, the gallows at Tyburn. He had six children, viz. Richard, Henry, Bridget, Elizabeth, Mary, and Frances. Richard succeeded him In the protectorate, but when affairs turned, and he found his post no longer tenable, he resigned, and went abroad. He died at Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, in 1712. Henry went to Ireland as lord-lieutenant, and bore a good character; he died in 1674. Bridget married first Ireton, and afterwards Fleetwood. Elizabeth, his favourite daughter, married John Claypole, esq. of Northamptonshire. Mary married lord Fauconberg, and is supposed to have assisted in the restoration of Charles II. She died in 1712. Frances married first a grandson of the earl of Warwick, and secondly sir John Russel of Cambridgeshire. Elizabeth the wife of Cromwell, was a woman of strong mind, and a constant spur to her husband in the career of his ambition. She also governed her household with great address.

When that prince fell, David was acknowledged king by the tribe of Judah; but the other tribes, at the instigation of Abner, placed Ishbosheth, the youngest son of Saul, on the throne, which occasioned a civil war; but on the death of Ishbosheth, the contending parties united in submission to David, who reigned thirty years with great glory. He took Jerusalem from the Jesusites, with the fortress of Zion, to which he gave the name of the city of David. He also gained considerable victories over the Philistines, and other neighbouring nations, thereby extending his dominions and enriching his subjects; but his glory was tarnished by taking Bathshebah from Uriah, her husband, and putting him to death.

But he soon repaired the loss, and with a fleet of 250 ships sailed to Athens, which he delivered from Demetrius Phalereus. He afterwards defeated Cassander at Thermopylae. For these exploits the Athenians raised statues to his honour, and even deified him. The successors of Alexander, alarmed at his progress, collected their forces, and marched against him, They met at Ipsus, B. C. 301; and after an obstinate battle, the army of Demetrius was defeated, and his father slain, but he himself fled to Ephesus, the ungrateful Athenians having refused him an asylum.

,,Demosthenes,Watkins,"The greatest orator of antiquity, was the son of an Athenian, who acquired great wealth by manufacturing sword-blades, and was born about 330 B. C. Having lost his father when a child his education was neglected, but at the age of seventeen he determined to study eloquence, though his lungs were weak, his pronunciation inarticulate, and his gestures aukward. But these impedients he conquered by perseverance, by declaiming as he walked up the side of steep hills, also on the sea-shore, when the weather was rough, and by putting pebbles in his mouth. To acquire a good gesture he used to practise before a mirror; and to correct a bad habit of shrugging up one of his shoulders, he placed a sharp pointed sword just over it in the place where he stood. The principles of his art he acquired under Isaeus, and he attended also the lectures of Plato. Not being ready at first in making extemporaneous harangues, he studied his orations with great care in a cave, on which account his enemies used to say, they smelt of the lamp. When he came into public life, the encroachments of Philip of Macedon alarmed all the Grecian states, particularly Athens. Demosthenes was forward in rousing his countrymen to a sense of their danger. He depicted the ambitious designs of Philip in glowing colours, and with so much effect, that similar orations are to this day called Philippics. When that monarch was about to invade Attica, Demosthenes was sent as ambassador to prevail on the Boeotians to assist them, in which mission he succeeded. He was also at the battle of Cheronea, where the orator played the coward and fled, for which severed accusations were preferred against him, but he was acquitted. On the death of Philip, he appeared in public with a garland on his head, though he had but just lost his daughter. Demosthenes thought this a favourable opportunity to destroy the Macedonian power, and by his exertions a new confederacy was formed among the Grecian states; which was then broken by the activity of Alexander. The influence of Demosthenes being on the decline, Aeschines took advantage of it to bring an accusation against him on the subject of his conduct at Cheronea, and his having had a crown of gold awarded him; but the orator so well defended himself in his celebrated oration De Corona; that he was honourably acquitted, and his adversary sent into exile. Shortly after, however, Demosthenes was convicted of receiving a golden cup and twenty talents from Harpalus, one of Alexander's generals, who had retired to Athens with a quantity of plunder, which he had gathered in Asia. To avoid punishment, he fled to Aegina, where he remained till the death of Alexander, when he was recalled by his countrymen, and brought home in triumph. But this change of fortune was of short duration. The victory of Antipater was followed by an order to the Athenians to deliver up Demosthenes, who fled to the temple of Neptune, at Calurina, where he poisoned himself, B. C. 322. The Athenians erected a statue to his memory, and maintained his eldest child at the public expence.

,,Des Cartes (Rene),Watkins,"A celebrated French philosopher, was born of a noble family at La Haye, in Touraine, in 1596. He received his education at the Jesuits' college at La Fleche, where he acquired a considerable knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages. On leaving that seminary he removed to Paris, and contracted an acquaintance with the celebrated father Mersenne, at whose instance he applied to the study of mathematics. In 1616 he entered into the army of the prince of Orange; and, while serving in the garrison at Breda, solved a difficult mathematical problem which had been posted in the public streets. This introduced him to the acquaintance, of the learned Beckman, principal of the college of Dort. While at Breda, he wrote in Latin, a treatise on music, and projected some other works. He next served in the army of the duke of Bavaria, but soon after quitted the military life, and travelled into Italy, where he saw the famous Galileo, at Florence. In 1629 he settled at Amsterdam, and applied assiduously to the mathematical sciences, particularly dioptrics, in which he made some important discoveries. About this time he visited England, and during his stay made observations on the declination of the magnetic needle. His philosophy now became the subject of much discussion, and met with an extensive reception, though with considerable opposition. Gilbert Voet, rector of the university of Utrecht, wrote against it, and Des Cartes replied with a virulence unbecoming a philosopher. At the invitation of Christina, queen of Sweden, he went to Stockholm, where he obtained a pension and an estate. He died in that city in 1650, and in 1666 his remains were conveyed to Paris, and interred with great pomp in the church of St. Genevieve.

His father going back to Ireland, to recover his effects, died of the plague, and his mother was soon after carried off in a decline. Being thus left destitute, the orphan was maintained first by sir H. Slingsby, his mother's brother, and next by Mr. H. Dodwell, his paternal uncle, rector of Newbourn and Henley, in Suffolk, who sent him to Trinity college, Dublin, where he became fellow, but quitted it in 1666, on account of the statute compelling all fellows to take orders. Soon after this he visited England, and resided some time at Oxford, but went back to Dublin, and in 1672 wrote a preface to a posthumous treatise left by his tutor Dr. Stearne. His next publication was two Letters on taking Holy Orders, and on Theological Study. In 1674 he returned to England, and settled in London, where he employed himself in writing against the Romanists and dissenters. In 1688 he was appointed Camden's professor of history at Oxford, but was deprived of that place in 1691, for refusing the oaths to king William, on which he retired to Cookham, and afterwards to Shottesbrooke in Berkshire. In 1634 he married, and became the father of ten children. In 1701 he published an account of the ancient Greek and Roman cycles, a quarto volume of which Dr. Halley had a high opinion. To follow him through his numerous publications would exceed our limits. He wrote against occasional communion, and opposed the nonjurors, in continuing the separation after the deaths of the deprived bishops; but his most famous book was on the Natural Mortality of the Soul, in which he endeavoured to prove, from scripture and the fathers, that ""it is immortalized actually by the pleasure of God, to punishment or reward, by its union with the divine baptismal spirit: this book made a great noise, and was answered by several writers, particularly Dr, Samuel Clarke. He wrote and edited several other works, and died at Shottesbrooke in 1711. Two of his sons attained to eminence. Henry, the eldest, was bred to the law, and was an active promoter of the society for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and commerce. He wrote an insidious pamphlet, without his name, entitled ""Christianity not founded on Argument,"" in which, under the pretence of friendship, he endeavoured to undermine the Christian religion. It was answered by Dr. Leland, Dr. Doddridge, and the author's brother, William , who was educated at Trinity college, Oxford, and became D. D. rector of Shottesbrooke, prebendary of Salisbury, and archdeacon of Berkshire. He wrote an answer to Dr. Middleton's Free Enquiry, and a Defence of the Answer against Mr. Toll, both in 1751; a Dissertation on Jephtha's Vow; and Practical Discourses, in 2 vols.",,,,1711.0,d.,62.0,D,d.

He entered early on the profession of arms, and distinguished himself in the service of different Italian states. At length his own country required him against the rebels of Corsica, whom he defeated. He was then appointed commander-in-chief of the galleys, and obtained great success against the African pirates. On the revolution breaking out in Genoa, he entered into the service of Francis I. of France, which he quitted for that of pope Clement VII. When Rome was taken he returned to the service of Francis. But not long after, he entered into the service of the emperor, which changed the French affairs in Italy. His new master offered to invest him with the sovereignty of Genoa, which he nobly refused, and only stipulated that the republic should continue under the imperial protection. In 1528 he delivered Genoa from the oppression of the French yoke, for which he was honoured by the senate with the title of the father and saviour of his country, and had a statue erected to his honour, and a palace built for him. He made his name famous through the Mediterranean by his naval exploits, particularly against Barbarossa and the African corsairs. He died in 1560.",,,Nouv. Dict. Hist.,1560.0,d.,63.0,,d.

In 1570, he went to the West Indies with two ships; and in 1572 made another expedition, which proved very successful. He next served under the earl of Essex, in Ireland, where he distinguished himself so much by his bravery, that sir Christopher Hatton introduced him to queen Elizabeth. In 1577 he made another voyage to the Spanish settlements in America, and sailed as far as 48 degrees north latitude, calling the country which he discovered New Albion. He then went to the East Indies, and having doubled the Cape of Good Hope, returned to Plymouth in 1580; which voyage round the world took up two years and nearly ten months. Queen Elizabeth went on board his ship at Deptford, and after dinner conferred on him the honour of knighthood. In 1585 he sailed again for the West Indies, where he took several places from the Spaniards, and returned laden with wealth. In 1587 he commanded a fleet of 30 sails, with which he entered Cadiz, and destroyed a quantity of shipping. The year following, he commanded as vice-admiral, under lord Howard, and was instrumental in the destruction of the Spanish armada. After this he went to the West Indies with sir John Hawkins, but the two commanders disagreeing in their plans, little was done by them. Drake died off Nombre de Dios in 1596.

He proeeeded to the degree of M. A. and in 1657 removed to London, where he wrote the year following an elegy on the death of Cromwell; and at the Restoration he complimented the king by a poem, entitled Astrea Redux. In 1665 he married lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the earl of Berkshire. On the establishment of the royal society, he was chosen one of the first members. In 1662 appeared his first play, called The Wild Gallant. Soon after the fire of London he engaged with the king's theatre for an annual stipend, on condition of furnishing a certain number of plays in each year. On the death of sir William Davenant he was nominated poet laureat; and about the same time he obtained the place of historiographer royal, with a salary of 200/. a year, and a butt of wine, his eminence as a dramatic writer exposed him to the envy of several rival wits: the duke of Buckingham held him up to ridicule in the character of Bays in The Rehearsal: and the earl of Rochester being offended at some things in an Essay on Satire, written jointly by our poet and lord Mulgrave caused the former to be cudgelled by some hired ruffians as he came home from a coffee-house. At the accession of James II. Dryden turned Roman catholic, and, like most converts, endeavoured to defend his new faith at the expence of the oId one, in a poem, called The Hind and Panther, which was admirably answered by Prior and Montague in The Country Mouse and the City Mouse. At the Revolution he lost his posts, and was succeeded by Shadwell, whom Dryden satirised under the name of Mac Flecknoe. In 1695 appeared his Translation of Virgil which alone would immortalize his memory. He died in 1700, and was buried in Westminster abbey, where is a monument to his memory, erected by Sheffield, duke of Buckingham. His works are too numerous to be particularly distinguished. His critical prefaces are admirable: and his poetry is correct, harmonious, and strong, particularly his satires. As a dramatic writer he chiefly excelled in tragedy. He had three sons: Charles became usher of the palace to pope Clement XI. and was drowned in 1704; John wrote a comedy, called The Husband his own Cuckold; and Henry entered into a religious order abroad. Though Dryden was addicted to astrology, yet the story of his predicting' the fate of his eldest son is untrue.",,,,1701.0,d.,63.0,P,d.

,,Erasmus (Desidenus),Watkins,"An illustrious writer, was born at Rotterdam in 1467. He was the illegitimate son of one Gerard, a native of Tergou, by the daughter of a physician. It was the intention of Gerard to have married his mistress, but being deceived by a false report of her death while he was in Italy, he entered into orders, which completely destroyed his good design. Erasmus was called Gerard, which he afterwards altered to the Latin name Desiderius, and the Greek Erasmus, all signifying amiable. At nine years of age he was sent to Deventer, in Gelderland, where he made a great progress in his studies. While he was at Deventer his mother died there of the plague, and his father soon followed her leaving our orphan to the care of three guardians, who determined on bringing him up to a religious life that they might epjoy his patrimony; for which purpose they removed him from one convent to another, till at last, in 1486, he took the habit among the canons-regular at Stein, near Tergou, The monastic life being disagreeable to him, he accepted an invitation from the archbishop of Cambray to reside with him. During his abode with this prelate he was ordained priest; but in 1466 he went to Paris, and supported himself by giving private lectures. In 1497 he visited England, and met with a liberal reception from the most eminent scholars, and applied to the study of the Greek language, of which he was before ignorant. His first literary works were philological, as his Adagia; De Copia Verborum; and De ratione Conscribendi Epistolas. In 1503 we find him at Louvain, where he studied divinity under Dr. Adrian Florent, afterwards Adrian VI. The next year came out his Enchiridion Militis Christiani, a book of practical religion. Not long after this he was again in England, for which country he had always a great regard. In 1506 he took his doctor's degree at Turin, and went to Bologna, where he continued some time; thence he removed to Venice, and resided with the famous Aldus Manutius. From Venice he went to Padua and Rome, where many offers were made him to settle; but haying received an invitation from Henry. VIII. he set out for England, and arrived in 1510. He at first lodged with sir Thomas More, and while there, wrote his Praise of Folly. Fisher, bishop of Rochester, invited him to Cambridge, where he was made lady Margaret's professor of divinity, and Greek professor. In 1514 we find him at Basil, preparing his New Testament, and Epistles of Jerome, for the press, which came out in 1516. This was the first time the New Testament was printed in Greek. The reformation now began under Luther, and though Erasmus approved of his principles and object, he was afraid to irritate the court of Rome. A friendly correspondence passed between these two great men, but afterwards a controversy ensued on the subject of free-will, and Luther treated Erasmus as a hypocrite. It is certain that Erasmus approved the reformation in his heart, but he had not courage to express himself openly; and the consequence was, that he was disliked by both parties. In 1522 appeared his Colloquies, which gave great offence to the monks, who used to say that ""Erasmus laid the egg which Luther hatched."" His next controversy was with Scaliger, and others, who, in their zeal for the purity of Latin composition, objected to the use of words not in the works of Cicero, whence they were called Ciceronians. Against these pedants Erasmus wrote an admirable dialogue, entitled Ciceronlanus, printed in 1528. The same year appeared his learned work, ""De recta Latinis Graecique Sermonis pronuntiatione."" His last publication was his Ecclesiastes, or the Manner of Preaching, 1535. He died at Basil in 1536, and was buried in the cathedral of that city. The inhabitants of Rotterdam still shew the house where he was born, and there is a statue erected to his memory in the great square of that city.

,,Devereux (Robert),Watkins,"Earl of Essex, was the son of Walter earl of Essex, and horn in 1567, at Netherwood in Herefordshire. Lord Burleigh was his guardian, and Dr. Whitgift his tutor at Cambridge. In 1585 he accompanied the earl of Leicester to Holland, where he behaved with bravery at the battle of Zutphen. On his return to England he was made master of the horse, and rose rapidly in the royal favour. In 1589 he went with sir Francis Drake and sir John Norris, in an expedition to Portugal, which gave great displeasure to the queen, it being without her consent. Her majesty was also offended with him for marrying a daughter of sir Francis Walsingham, and the widow of sir Philip Sidney. In 1591 he commanded the forces sent to the assistance of Henry IV of France, which expedition was unsuccessful. In 1596 he was appointed joint-commander with lord Howard in an expedition against Spain, where he contributed to the capture of Cadiz. After this he had the command of a fleet sent out to intercept the Spanish plate fleet, but nothing was done except the taking of Fayal by a separate division of the squadron, commanded by sir Walter Raleigh, which produced a dispute between him and the earl. In 1597 Essex was made earl marshal of England, and the following year spoke vehemently against a peace with Spain, which measure was supported by Burleigh, who keenly rebuked his opponent, by quoting the verse in the Psalms which says, ""men of blood shall not live out half their days."" On the death of that great statesman Essex succeeded him as chancellor of Cambridge. About this time he incurred the queen's displeasure in a remarkable manner: at a private council held respecting the appointment of a proper person to govern Ireland, he had the imprudence to oppose her majesty with rudeness, on which she gave him a box on the ear. The violent earl instantly laid his hand on his sword, and swore he would not have taken such treatment even from her father. He then withdrew, and instead of making his submission, continued to complain of the treatment he had received. At length a reconciliation was effected, and the earl went to Ireland, where he met with bad success. His enemies in the mean time gave it out that he meant to invade England, and an army was in consequence raised under the earl of Nottingham. Hearing of these proceedings he returned to England, and waited on the queen, who gave him a better reception than could have been expected. However he soon fell into disgrace, and was imprisoned. In 1600 he regained his liberty, but instead of conducting himself with caution, he began to vent his indignation in virulent terms, and said, that ""the queen grew old and cankered, and that her mind was become as crooked as her carcase."" His enemies having intelligence of his actions and speeches, sent for him to attend the council, which he refused, and began to arm in his own defence. Some blood was shed before he surrendered, on which he was made close prisoner, tried, and beheaded, in 1601. A popular story is told of the queen's having given him a ring as a pledge of security, on his sending of which, at any time, he should receive his pardon. This ring, it is said, he gave to the countess of Nottingham, his relation, and the wife of his inveterate enemy the admiral, in obedience to whose orders the countess kept it, and the unhappy Essex suffered. On her death-bed she is stated to have confessed the fact to Elizabeth, who said, that ""God might forgive her, hut she never could."" The foundation of this story is uncertain; but it has served to embellish a tragedy called the Earl of Essex.",,,,1601.0,d.,65.0,,d.,,,147,Essex E. of,Essex,20.0,Statesmen and Warriors,Great Britain,127.0,male,851.0,D,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Devereux,_2nd_Earl_of_Essex",1556.0,1601.0,case2

,,Eugene (Francis),Watkins,"Prince of Savoy, was born in 1663. His father was the count of Soissons; and his mother niece to cardinal Mazarine. He was intended for the church, but the death of his father altered the design, and he resolved to follow a military life. His mother being banished to the Netherlands, he went to Vienna, where the emperor gave him a regiment of dragoons, and he served with great reputation against the Turks in Hungary. In 1691 he was sent to Piedmont, where he relieved Coni, which was besieged by the French, and took Carmagnole. In 1597 he obtained the chief command of the Imperial army, and the same year defeated the Turks at the battle of Buda. On the death of the king of Spain, the emperor laid claim to that throne, and a new war breaking out, prince Eugene was sent to Italy, where he defeated Catinat the French general, who was succeeded by Villeroi; but while this general lay secure, as he thought, at Cremona, the prince entered the place by stratagem, and took him prisoner. Soon after this he returned to Vienna, and was made president of the council, and associated in the command of the allied army with the great duke of Marlborough. In 1704 he had a principal share in the famous battle of Blenheim. In 1707 he was repulsed at Cassano by Vendome, but he soon recovered his reputation by a bloody action near Turin, which was then besieged by the French, whose trenches he forced, and gained a complete victory. The same year he entered France, and laid siege to Toulon, but was unsuccessful. The next year he commanded the Imperial army in Flanders, and shared in the victory of Oudenard as he afterwards did that of Malplaquet. In this last battle he was severely wounded, but would not quit the scene of action. In 1712 he was at London, to induce the English ministers not to make a separate peace, but his arguments were ineffectual: and he was left to finish the war alone. After this detection his progress was weak, and he was successfully opposed by marshal Villars, with whom he entered into a negotiation which produced the peace of Radstadt in 1714. Shortly after this a war broke out between the emperor and the Turks, on which the prince was again entrusted with the command in Hungary, where, in 1716, he defeated the grand vizier at Peterwaradin, which was followed by the capture of Belgrade. After the peace of 1718 he retired to a private life: but in 1733, when the election for the crown of Poland was disputed, he was again employed. His service, however, was short, and unproductive of any remarkable action. He died at Vienna in 1736.

On this Fabius sold his estates to raise the money. When the time of his dictatorship expired, he advised his successor, Paulus Aemilius, not to hazard an engagement, which, however, was neglected, and thus was lost the famous battle of Cannae.

In 1689 he became tutor to the dukes of Burgundy, Anjou, and Berri, which office he discharged so well, that in 1595 he was preferred to the archbishopric of Cambray. About this time be fell into trouble, on account of his book entituled, The Maxims of the Saints, which was charged with favouring the principles of madame de Guyon.

The book was condemned at Rome; and to this censure Fenelon submitted with profound difference, and even read the pope's decree from the pulpit. He spent the remainder of his days in his diocese, and never recovered the king's favour, owing in a great measure to his composing for his royal pupil, the duke of Burgundy, that inestimable work for the instruction of a prince, Telemachus, which Lewis considered as a satire upon himself.

,,Fielding (Henry),Watkins,"A celebrated writer, was born at Sharpham, in Somersetshire, of a good family, in 1707. After receiving the rudiments of education at home, he went to Eton, from whence he was sent to Leyden, where he studied two years, and then returned to England, The narrowness of his father's circumstances and the largeness of his family, prevented him from providing for his son in a proper manner. He then commenced writer for the stage, his first piece being entitled, Love in several Masques, which met with a favourable reception: as did his next performance, called The Temple beau. Some of his dramatic efforts, however, were not so successful, and he had the courage to prefix to one of them, ""As it was damned at the theatre-royal, Drury-lane."" He afterwards had the good luck to marry a lady of some fortune, and by the death of his mother, he came into the possession of 200/. a year. His extravagances, however, were such, that at the age of thirty he had reduced himself to his former condition, on which he entered the Temple, and studied the law with considerable ardour, still exercising his pen for immediate support. One of his publications was, The History of Jonathan Wild, a notorious character, whose story Fielding wrought up into an entertaining romance. In 1742, appeared his Joseph Andrews, a novel, full of humour and admirable delineations of human nature. During the rebellion of 1745, he published some patriotic pieces, for which he was made a Middlesex justice, in which situation he gained considerable reputation, by his Enquiry into the Causes of the late Increase of Robberies; and his Proposal for the Maintenance of the Poor. About this time he wrote his principal work, the novel of Tom Jones; which exhibits a great knowledge of life, and is equally rich in comic delineation and pathetic expression. The moral, however is suspicious. His Amelia, which followed in 1751, is more correct in its sentiment but deficient in humour and variety.

,,Galilei (Galileo),Watkins,"A celebrated astronomer, was the son of a Florentine nobleman, and born at Pisa in 1564. His father was desirous that he should study medicine; but he attached himself to mathematics, and at the age of 25 was made mathematical professor at Pisa, from whence he removed to Padua. In 1609 having heard that Jansen had invented a glass by which objects at a distance were rendered as visible as if near, he tinned his attention to the subject and constructed a telescope, by means of which he discovered the irregularities of the Moon's surface and that of Venus. He also found that the Via Lactea is an assemblage of fixed stars; and by assiduous application of his invention, he made many other important discoveries in the heavens. But his assertion of the earth's motion gave such offence to the inquisitors, that in 1615 he was cited to Rome, and required to recant these propositions, that the sun is the centre of the world, and that the earth is not the center of the world, but has a diurnal motion. After being confined a few months, he was released, and charged not to defend these heretical opinions either by word or writing. In 1632. he published at Florence his Dialogues on the Ptolemaic and Copernican Systems of the World, for which he was cited to Rome; his book ordered to publicly burnt; the author sentenced to be imprisoned, to make another recantation of his errors, and, by way of penance, to recite the seven penitential psalms once a week. This sentence however was changed by the pope, and Galileo obtained his liberty. He then retired to his house near Florence, where he continued his observations till he became blind by intense application. He died in 1642. His principal works are. The Operations of the Compass; on the Swimming of Bodies; Mechanics; Nuncius Sidercus; on the Trepidation of the Moon; Discourse of the solar Spots. Mathematical Discourses and Demonstrations; Treatise of the Mundane System. His son Vincenza Galilei was the first who applied his father's invention of the pendulum to clock-work.

About three years afterwards he became professor of philosophy at Aix, when he ventured to oppose the system of Aristotle, and his lectures were published under the title of Exercitationes paradoxicae adversus Aristotelem. This work procured him the friendship of the celebrated Peiresc, by whose interest he was preferred to a canonry in the cathedral of Digne. In 1615 he was appointed royal professor of mathematics at Paris, where he applied so intensely to his studies, and to astronomical observations, as brought him into a consumption, of which he died in 1655. Gassendi is deservedly ranked among the first mathematicians of his age. He opposed the philosophy of Des Cartes with success, and obtained, a number of followers, who were called after his name.

,,Gay (John),Watkins,"An English poet, was born at or near Barnstaple in Devonshire in 1688, and educated at the grammar school in that town under Mr. Luck, a man of wit and a poet. He was afterwards apprenticed to a silk-mercer in London, which situation he did not like, and in a few years bought the remainder of his time. His first poem, entitled Rural Sports, printed in 1711, and dedicated to Mr. Pope, gained him the friendship of that poet, which lasted till death. The year following he was appointed secretary to the duchess of Monmouth. At this time he printed his mock heroic, entititled, Trivia, or the Art of walking the Streets of London, in the composition of which he was assisted by Swift. In 1714 appeared his Shepherd's Week, a series of pastorals, intended to ridicule Phillips, but they possess more merit as a genuine picture of rustic life than as a satire. The same year he became secretary to the earl of Clarendon on his embassy to Hanover, On the death of queen Anne he returned to England, but his expectations of preferment from the new court were disappointed. In 1720 he published his Poems, by subscription, which produced him one thousand pounds; but embarking it in the famous South-Sea bubble, he lost the whole, and was reduced to such a state of despondency as was nearly fatal. He next produced the tragedy of the Captive, which met with a good reception, and occasioned his being employed by the princess of Wales to write his Fables for the young duke of Cumberland. In 1727 appeared on the stage his Beggar's Opera, which had a sucsess infinitely beyond what it deserved both in a dramatic and moral point of view. Though it was a favourite with the town, it was not so at court: and when he produced his Sequel to it, under the title of ""Polly,'' it was prohibited by the lord chamberlain. Gay, however, cleared more by printing it than he would have done by its performance. The duke and duchess of Queensbury took him into their house, where he died in 1732.

,,Grotius (Hugo),Watkins,"An illustrious writer, was the son of John de Groot, (the family name), a burgomaster of Delft, where the son was born in 1583. At the age of eight years he composed Latin verses of great merit. In his twelfth year he was sent to Leyden under the care of Francis Junius. In 1598 he accompanied the ambassador Barnevelt to the court of Henry IV. of France, who was so pleased with Grotius, that he gave him his picture and a gold chain; while in France he took the degree of doctor of laws. The year following he commenced practice as an advocate, and pleaded his first cause at Delft. Soon afterwards he published an edition of Martianus Capella, which was well received by the learned. This was followed by a translation of a work of Stevinus, on finding a ship's place at sea. His edition of the Phenomena of Aratus appeared in 1600, and about the same time he composed Latin Tragedies on sacred subjects. He was now appointed historiographer of the United Provinces, and advocate-general of the treasury for Holland and Zealand. In 1609 he published his famous book on the liberty of the sea, which was answered by the learned Selden. About this time appeared his Treatise de Antiquitate Rcipublicae Bartavae, to prove the independence of Batavia of the Romans. In 1613 he accepted the post of pensioner of Rotterdam, by which means he obtained a seat in the states of Holland. About this time he was sent to England to settle a dispute on the subject of the Greenland fishery. During the contests which arose in Holland on account of religion, Grotius sided with the Arminians, for which he was condemned to perpetual imprisonment in the castle of Louvestein, from whence he was delivered by his wife. This excellent woman having obtained leave to convey away a chest of books, for fear her husband should injure his health by over-study, Grotius was placed in the chest, and taken out of the castle. As the soldiers were carrying the chest, one of them said it was so heavy that there must be an Arminian in it; to which madame Grotius answered, that there were indeed many Arminian books. When the chest was brought out of the castle, it was conveyed to Goreum, from whence Grotius went to Antwerp, and afterwards to France, where he obtained a pension. In 1622 he published his Apology, which so stung the States, that they ordered it to be burnt, and the author to be seized wherever he could be found. In 1625 he finished his famous book De Jure Belli & Pacis, which greatly extended his reputation. In 1613 he accepted an invitation from count Oxenstiern, and went to Stockholm, where he was appointed counsellor of state, and ambassador to the court of France. He filled this important station, amidst circumstances of extreme difficulty, with honour to himself, and satisfaction to the court which he represented. In 1645 he quitted France, and went to Holland, where he was honourably received. From Amsterdam he sailed to Sweden, and was welcomed in a cordial manner by queen Christina. He died on his journey to Holland, at Rostock, August 28, the same year. His remains were interred at Delft. The works of this great man are too many to be enumerated here; but we must mention his treatise on the Truth of the Christian Religion, which has become a standard book in all universities, for students in divinity his Annales & Historiae de Rebus Belgicis; and his Commentaries on the Scriptures; these last are an immortal monument of learning. In his religious sentiments he coincided with the church of England, and advised his wife to join in communion with it. His sons Cornelius and Diederic entered into the army. Peter was bred to the law, and became pensionary of Amsterdam. His brother William was a learned man, and wrote some books on loyal subjects.",,,,1645.0,d.,70.0,D,d.

,,Halley (Edmund),Watkins,"A celebrated astronomer, was born in London, in 1656, and educated at St. Paul's school, from whence he was sent to Queen's college, Oxford, where he chiefly applied to the mathematics particularly astronomy. He made a number of observations, and having formed the design of completing the scheme of the heavens by the addition of the stars near the south pole, he went to St. Helena in 1676, and fiiiished his catalogue. On his return he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1679 he went to Dantzic to confer with Hevelius about the dispute between him and Dr. Hooke, respecting the preference of plain or glass sights in astronomical instruments. In 1680 happened the great comet, which Mr. Halley first observed in his passage from Dover to Calais. He afterwards completed his observations upon it at the royal observatory at Paris. From thence he went to Italy with Mr. Robert Nelson, and in 1681 returned to England. In 1686 Mr. Newton committed to his care the publication of his Principia, to which Halley prefixed some Latin verses. In 1698 he was appointed commander of a ship sent out for the purpose of trying his theory of the variation of the compass. The year following he matle another voyage with the same design, and from his observations he constructed his General Chart, exhibiting the variation of the compass in most parts of the ocean . He was sent on a third v oyage to ascertain the course of the tides in the British channel, of which he also published a chart.

On his return in 1703, the degree of doctor of laws was conferred on him by the university of Oxford.

,,Handel (George Frederic),Watkins,"An illustrious musician, was born at Halle in Saxony, in 1684. His father who intended him for the law, percieving his propensity to music, prohibited all instruments from his house. The son, however, contrived to have a small clavichord concealed in the garret where he used to amuse himself when the family were asleep. At the age of seven he went with his father to the court of the duke of Saxe Weissenfels, to whom Handel's brother-in-law was valet. While there he got into the church one morning and began to play on the organ. The Duke, who was in the church, surprized at the playing, asked who it was, and on being informed, he expostulated with the old gentleman for restraining his son's inclination, in consequence of which a master was provided for him. Handel made so great a progress, that at the age of nine he composed the church service. In 1698 he went to Berlin, where he was greatly noticed by the king of Prussia. From thence he went to Hamburg, and had a dispute with another musician, who made a push at him with his sword as they were coming out of the orchestra, but a music-book in his bosom prevented the weapon from piercing his heart. Here he composed, at the age of 14, his opera of Almeria. Soon after this he visited Italy, and at Florence produced the opera of Rodrigo. In 1710 he visited England, but being under an engagement to the elector of Hanover, his stay was short. In 1712 he returned, and obtained a pension of 200/. a year, which was afterwards doubled. Some of the nobility projected a plan for erecting an academy in the Haymarket to secure a supply of operas, composed by Handel, and under his direction. This plan was carried into effect, and succeeded for about ten years, and then fell to the ground when the rage for Italian music prevailed, and Handel could not stop the progress of the delusion. But in 1742 his popularity returned, and he retained his glory to the last. He died in 1759, and was buried in Westminster abbey, where there is an elegant monument to his memory. But his greatest monument is in his works, a complete edition of which was published by Dr. Arnold.",,,,1759.0,d.,,Mu,d.

He is said to have crossed the Alps by softening the rocks with fire and vinegar. On his arrival in Italy he defeated Cornelius Scipio, and obtained several victories over the most experienced Roman generals, particularly at Cannae, where the Romans lost about 40,000 men, and had Hannibal pushed on for Rome it must have fallen. But by stopping at Capua, where his soldiers gave themselves up to luxury, the Romans recovered from their surprize; and when he appeared before the city, it excited so little concern, that the ground on which he was encamped was put up for sale, and sold at a high price. He soon retired and experienced a defeat near Zama.

,,A. Rashid.,Aikin,"caliph of the Saracens, was the second son of the caliph Mahadi or Mohdi. In early youth he acquired military renown in the command of an expedition sent by his father against the Greek empress Irene, in which he laid waste several of the Asiatic provinces of the empire, spread an alarm to Constantinople itself, and compelled the empress to purchase peace by a tribute. After the short reign of his elder brother Hadi, he succeeded to the caliphate A.D. 786, being then about twenty-four years of age. He was the most potent and vigorous monarch of his race, and ruled over territories extending from Egypt to Khorasan. The name of al Rasbid, the Righteous, or Just, was conferred upon him as an illustrious example of that virtue; but his justice, like that of most despots, was sullied by occasional acts of violence and caprice. One of his noblest qualities was a love of learning and science, which he patronised with so magnificent a spirit, that his court became the resort of the most eminent literary characters of his time. He caused many Latin and Greek authors to be translated into Arabic, and dispersed copies of their works over his whole empire. He first made the Iliad and Odyssey known to the eastern poets, who, it must be confessed, never imbibed much of the taste of European composition. He was extremely magnificent to his physicians, of whom the most trusted were Christians of the family of Baktishua (see that article). Of the events of this reign, one of the first was an incursion of the king of the Khozars, who committed great ravages before he could be opposed by the caliph's troops, who were employed in an invasion of the empress Irene's dominions, consequent upon her breach of the truce between them. In 792 a rebellion was raised in the province of Deylam by Yahia a descendant of AH, who was declared caliph. Haroun sent his general Al Fadi at the head of an army to suppress it. By an artful negotiation he persuaded Yahia to quit his party and trust himself to the clemency of the caliph, who sent him a promise under his own hand of security for life and liberty. On his first airival at Bagdad he was graciously received; but Haroun's suspicions at length induced him first to imprison, and then to put him to death; an action which greatly sullied his character in the eyes of the most respectable of his subjects. But the men of learning whom he paid, and the devotees whom he conciliated by religious zeal, and particularly by a pilgrimage on foot to Mecca, treated him with their accustomed adulation. His deference, indeed, for the doctors of his religion was very great; and it is recorded that one Malek, the founder of an orthodox Mahometan sect, having been sent for by the caliph in order to instruct his sons, and returning an answer, that ""knowledge would not wait upon any person, but was itself to be waited upon,"" Haroun owned that he was in the right, and directed that his children should attend him at the public school. Haroun is said eight times to have invaded the Greek empire. On the deposition of Irene, and the succession of Nicephorus in 802, the new emperor refused to pay tribute to the caliph, and intimated, by a present of swords delivered with an epistle, that he was ready to trust his cause to the decision of arms. The caliph ordered the swords to be fixed together in the ground, and drawing his scymetar cut them all asunder at a stroke. He then dictated the following characteristic epistle: ""In the name of the most merciful God: Haroun al Rashid, Commander of the Faithful, to Nicephorus the Roman dog: I have read thy letter, O you son of an unbelieving mother! Thou shalt not hear, but shalt behold, my reply."" This menace was made good by an irruption into Greece, the provinces of which were laid waste by the Saracens with sword and fire, while at the same time a fleet disembarked a body of troops on the isle of Cyprus which was treated in a similar manner. In subsequent campaigns, Nicephorus was defeated in person by Haroun, great part of Asia Minor was overrun by the tirms of the Saracens, and Heraclca, a city on the Black Sea, was totally destroyed. The war, after several renewals, was finally terminated by a treaty in which Nicephorus agreed to pay an augmentation of tribute, and not to rebuild Heraclea and the other ruined towns. During the course of these transactions, the ruin of the family of the Barmacides gave a striking example of the despotic rigour which was a part of Haroun's character. Yahia, the head of this family, had superintended the caliph's education, and assisted in his government. Of his four sons, Al Fadl, the eldest, was a successful general; Jaafar (Giaffar), the second, was the caliph's vizir and declared favourite, and distinguished himself by his proficiency in politer literature; Mahomet and Musa, the two youngest, were a!so in dignified stations. They were all educated in opulence, and had imbibed sentiments worthy of their fortune. Their generosity, munificence, and arEibility,rer.dered them the darlings of all ranks of people. Jaafar was so much in his master's good graces, that he could not endure to be without his company; and being equally attached to his own sister Abbasa, he thought fit to break through the eastern formality of excluding unmarried females from the view of the other sex. A mutual passion was the consequence, which the caliph so far indulged as to permit a marriage between his sister and the vizir, but with die cruel restriction of their abstaining from the privileges of such an union. Passion broke through this unjust prohibition (see the article ABBASA); the consequences could not be concealed; and this circumstance is commonly said to have brought down the monarch's vengeance upon the head of Jaafar and his family. Others rather impute the catastrophe to his jealousy of their riches and influence. Whatever were the cause, Jaafar was publicly executed; his venerable father was imprisoned, and either died or was put to death in prison; and the property of the whole race was confiscated. A decree was even made forbidding on pain of death all mention of the names or actions of the Barmacides; but a grateful old man who ventured openly to disobey it, obtained his pardon and a present from the caliph. Haroun attained the summit of worldly prosperity, and was certainly the richest and most potent sovereign of his time. The French historians mention a splendid embassy which he sent to Charlemagne, which, among other presents, brought a magnificent tent, a waterclock, an elephant, and the keys of the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem, denoting permission for European pilgrims to visit it. In common with the western monarch, he adopted the plan of making a division of his extensive dominions between his three sons a fertile source of future civil wars. Like him, too, he passed a life of great activity, frequently visiting his most distant provinces. His principal residence was a favourite palace at Racca on the Euphrates. After a return from an expedition to quiet some commotions in Persia, he was seized with great dejection of spirits, and an apprehension of soon falling into some mortal distemper. By proper remedies he was almost recovered, when the revolt of a captain named Rafe ebn Leith in the provinces beyond the Oxus, summoned him into the field. He marched at the head of a powerful army, but on his arrival at the frontiers, he found himself too much indisposed to proceed. Retiring to Tous in Khorasan, he sunk into his former state of despondence, and died in October, 808, at the age of forty-seven, after a reign of twenty-three years. His last command was that of cutting in pieces before his face the brother of the rebel against whom he was marching. It can only have been in comparison with other Saracen princes that he is extolled for humanity; but in alms-giving, in punctilious demotion, in liberality to poets and men of letters, in courage and activity, he has had few superiors among sovereigns. Nor was he incapable of just and generous sentiments when reflection was not impeded by passion. He could occasionally bear bold remonstrances, of which the following story is an instance. In one of his military progresses, a woman came to him with a complaint that some of his soldiers had pillaged her house. ""Hast thou not read,"" said Haroun, ""in the Koran, that where princes pass with their armies they make places desolate ?"" ""True,"" replied the woman; ""but I have also read in the same Koran, that the houses of those princes shall be made desolate for their injustice."" Haroun was struck with the answer, and ordered full restitution to be made to the petitioner. The popular fame of this great caliph is evinced by the Arabian Nights Entertuinments, in which Haroun, with his queen Zobeide, his vizir Giafar, and his chief eunuch Mesrour, are the actors in a great number of the tales.",,,,809.0,d.,72.0,,d.

On all occasions he displayed an intrepid mind, as well as a profound knowledgeof the common law; and a greater proof of his regard to the rights of the people cannot be given than in the following instance: There happened in his time a riot, occasioned by the practice of decoying young persons to the plantations, who were confined in a house in Holborn till they could be shipped off. Notice of the riot being sent to Whitehall, a party of the military were ordered out, but before they marched an officer was sent to the chief-justice to desire him to send some of his people with the soldiers. Holt asked the officer what he intended to do if the mob refused to disperse: ""My lord (replied he), we have orders to fire upon them."" ""Have you so?"" said Holt, ""then observe what I say; if one man is killed, I will take care that you and every soldier of your party shall be hanged. Sir, acquaint those who sent you, that no officer of mine shall attend soldiers; and let them know likewise, that the laws of this land are not to be executed by the sword : these things belong to the civil power, and you have nothing to do with them.""

fl.,-850.0,Homer,Watkins,"The father of Greek poetry, was born on the banks of the river Meles, whence his mother called him Melesigenes. He was a natural child, but his mother afterwards married one Phenius, a citizen of Smyrna, who adopted the child as his son. His birth, however, is involved in so much obscurity that all this may be fable, for the ancients are not agreed as to the period in which he flourished, and seven cities disputed the honour of having given him birth. He is said to have kept a school at Smyrna, and that he afterwards accompanied Mentes, a master of a ship, in several voyages, and by him was left at Ithaca, where he gathered many particulars respecting Ulysses, which laid the foundation of the Odyssey. At length Mentes returned and took him on board again, but at Colophon he had the misfortune of losing his sight. He then became a strolling hard and obtained the name of Homer, which signifies a blind man. It is further added, that being at Phoctea, a school-master, named Thestorides, offered to maintain him, provided he would suffer him to transcribe his verses, which he agreed to from necessity. The school-master then went to Chios, where he acquired great wealth by Homer's poems, while the poet himself could scarcely get bread by reciting them. Homer on this proceeded to Chios and Thestorides, hearing of his arrival, fled before him. Here the poet opened a school of poetry, married, and had two daughters. He died about 907 years B. C. The only genuine works of his extant, are the Iliad and Odyssey. The Batrachomyomachia, or Battle of the Frogs and Mice, has been disputed, but many good critics deem it to be his. The Hymns which go under his name are questionable. The best editions of Homer are, that of Barnes, Cambridge, 2 vols. 4to. 1711; Clarke's, 4 vols.; that of Glasgow, 2 vols. folio, 1758; that of Oxford, 5 vols. 8vo. 1780; and what is called the Grenville edition, recently published from the same press.

That there are divine precepts which even good men cannot obey without the assistance of God. —2. That no man can resist the influence of divine grace on his mind. —3. That to render human actions meritorious, it is not necessary for them to be free from necessity but constraint. —4. That the doctrine of free-will is a gross error. —5.

fl.,-937.0,Jason,Aikin,"a hero in the semi-fabulous age of Greece, was the son of Aeson king of Thessaly. On his father's death or retreat from government, the guardianship of Jason and regency of the kingdom were committed to Pelias, the maternal brother of Aeson. The young prince was sent for education to Chiron, whom fable has represented as a centaur. When he was grown to manhood, Pelias, desirous of securing the kingdom to himself, sent Jason on the expedition which has made his name so famous, under the title of the Argonautic, and the object of which was to bring a certain golden fleece from Colchis, a country at the extremity of the Euxine or Black sea, the modern Mingrelia. It has been a subject of various conjecture what the fabulists have disguised under the fiction of the golden-fleece; the most probable supposition seems to be, that the particles of gold washed down from the mountains by certain streams in that country were received upon fleeces sunk in their beds, and that the fame of the riches obtained in this manner had reached Greece, and excited a desire of pillage. Such an opinion seems more conformable to the character of those heroic ages, than that of a commercial voyage to bring back either an extraordinary breed of fine-woolled sheep, or any article of woollen manufacture. The intended expedition being made known through Greece, brought a number of young men of the first families to join it as adventurers, and many names of the most celebrated of the early heroes are found among them. A galley of fifty oars was equipped in the Pagasean bay, which was named after its builder, the Argo. This is generally represented as the sole vessel; but some accounts, more probably, relate that several others were fitted out for the enterprise. This memorable voyage is by most chronologers dated in the thirteenth century B.C. The adventures that befel the navigators in their voyage have given great scope for poetical fiction and exaggeration, in which there is probably a foundation of traditionary truth. Those which ensued after their arrival at Colchis are still more obscured by the marvellous; but we may gather that the Argonauts succeeded in their purpose, partly by their own valour, and partly by the assistance of Medea, daughter of the king Aetes, who fell in love with Jason, and accompanied him on his return. Jason found Pelias established on the throne of Thessaly; and after his death, Acastus, his son, who succeeded him, expelled Jason and Medea from the country. They retired to Corinth, where they lived several years in peace under the protection of the king Glaucus, or Creon. At length Creon having given his daughter as a second wife to Jason, the jealous rage of Medea induced her to kill her two children by him, and set the palace on fire, in which it is said that Jason, with his new wife, was consumed. Other writers tell the story differently, and suppose them to have been afterwards reconciled. It is impossible to ascertain the exact truth respecting the latter history of this hero amidst so many varying narrations of poets and fabulists; but the preceding narrative seems on the whole to possess the greatest share of probability.",,,,,,76.0,,fl.,,,148,Jason,Jason,21.0,Statesmen and Warriors,,127.0,male,1268.0,A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason,-967.0,-922.0,case3

,,Jerome (St.),Watkins,"A father of the church, was born of Christian parents near Dalmatia, about 340.

Being of a pious and sedentary turn, he was disgusted with the capital, and resolved to lead a solitary life. He accordingly retired to the deserts of Syria, where he spent four years in severe study and mortification. He then went to Antioch, and was ordained priest. In 381 he went to Constantinople, from whence he passed to Rome, where pope Damasus consulted him on several passages of the holy writings. His eloquence, learning, and virtues, procured him several female disciples of rank, which excited the envy of the priests, who propagated gross calumnies against his character. Jerome then quitted Rome, and retired to the Holy Land, where he superintended several monasteries, particularly at Bethlehem.

,,Julian,Watkins,"Emperor of Rome, surnamed the Apostate, was the younger son of Julius Constantius, brother of Constantine the Great, and born in 331. In the massacre made of his family by the sons of Constantine, he and his brother Gallus narrowly escaped. The two princes were educated in the princioles of Christianity under Mardonius, but with different effects, for though Galius possessed real piety, the attachment of Julian to that religion was merely affected, having secretly a strong inclination to paganism. Being sent to Athens at the age of twenty-four, he discovered this disposition by his application to astrology, magic, and other illusions. He attached himself particularly to a philosopher named Maximus, who flattered his ambition by promising him the empire. He commanded with reputation in Gaul in the reign of Constantius, who, jealous of his success and popularity, sent to recall him, which gave so much offence to his soldiers that they proclaimed him emperor, and on the death of Constantius in 361, he found himself in full possession of the imperial throne. He was then in the East, where his title was recognize as readily as it had been in the West. He then threw off the mask, publicly renounced Christianity, and opened the temples of the gods, in which he offered sacrifices. On this account he is called the Apostate. Soon after his accession he resolved to chastise the Persians, who had frequently made inroads on the empire in the preceding reigns. When he crossed the Tigris he burned his ships that his soldiers might proceed with firmness and resolution. On his return, after marching through Assyria without opposition, his army encountered that of Sapor king of Persia, and Julian was mortally wounded, A. D. 363, aged. 32. Theocloret asserts, that he took some of the blood from his wound, and casting it towards heaven, exclaimed, Thou hast conquered, Galilean! a story which is hardly credible. Julian was virtuous and modest in his manners, and liberal in his disposition. He abolished the luxrious and indecent practices of the court of Constantinople, and was averse to public amusements. His History of the Caesars is the most celebrated of His writings, though it is very partial. His works were published by Spanheim at Leipsic in 1696, folio.",,,,363.0,d.,79.0,,d.

On the death of his father he was opposed by Louis II. duke of Anjou, which occasioned some bloody wars.

fl.,-196.0,"Laelius, Caius",Aikin,"surnamed the Wise, supposed to have been the son of the preceding, was equally distinguished with the former by his friendship with the second Scipio Africanus. He was likewise an eminent orator, and a cultivator of polite literature, having been a disciple of Diogenes the Stoic, and of Panaerius. He signalized his courage in the war against Viriathus in Spain, but was chiefly known by his civil honours. His oratory is by Cicero described as of the mild and elegant kind, to which his temper of mind was adapted; for he is said never on any occasion to have displayed a change of countenance. His surname, according to Cicero, was derived from the philosophic temperance of his mode of living; but Plutarch ascribes it to the prudence with which he dropped a project for improving the condition of the plebeians, when he found that it would meet with a violent opposition. He was a member of the college of augurs, and pronounced one of his most famous orations in that capacity. He attained the consulship in the year B.C. 140. When his friend Scipio quitted all concern in public affairs, Laelius accompanied him to his country retreat of Liternum, where these two great men were not ashamed, according to Cicero's expression, to grow boys again, and divert themselves with throwing pebbles on the sea shore. That writer has immortalized their connexion by making it the base of his dialogue on friendship, in which Laelius appears as the chief speaker. He passed a long life in conjugal union with a single wife, in whom was centered all his attachment to the sex.

After receiving his academical education at London, he went to Utrecht, and from thence to Leyden, where he followed his studies with close application, and then returned to England. Soon afterwards he became tutor to the son of lady Treby, in which comfortable situation he continued until her ladyship's death, in 1721. This event threw him into circumstances of some perplexity, having preached to several congregations during his residence with lady Treby, without the approbation or choice of any one of them. In 1723 he was engaged with other ministers in a course of lectures at a meeting in the Old Jewry, but he did not obtain a fixed settlement till 1729, when he became pastor of a congregation in Crutched Friars. He wrote an excellent answer to Woolston on the Miracles, and about the same time, a Letter on the Logos. In 1733 appeared the first part of the Credibility of the Gospel History, a work admirably executed. The university of Aberdeen conferred on him the degree of D. D. for his useful labours. He died at his native place in 1768. His works have been published in 11 vols. 8vo. They abound in critical elucidations of the scripture, and early ecclesiastical history, evincing profound learning and intense application.

,,Latimer (Hugh),Watkins,"An excellent prelate martyr, was born at Thurcaston, in Leicestershire, of humble parentage, in 1475. He recieved a good education at Cambridge, where at the Beginning of the Reformation he was very zealous for popery, but on conversing with Bilney the martyr, he renounced the Romish tenets, and became as ardent on the other side. He now laboured earnestly in preaching the gospel, and his fame reaching Henry VIII. He sent for him, and was so pleased with his discourses as to confer on him the bishopric of Worcester. But Latimer was no timeserver: on the contrary he expostulated with the king for his cruelties and went so far as to present him a New Testament with a leaf doubled down to the text ""whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."" He afterwards resingned his bishopric; and on the fall of lord Cromwell, his patron, he was sent to the Tower, where he remained till the accension of Edward VI. who would have restored him to the diocese which he refused. He then resided with Cranme, whom he assisted in framing the homilies, and in completing the work of reformation. When Mary came to the throne he was committed to the Tower, from whence he was sent with Ridley and Cranmer to Oxford, to have a conference with some popish divines. In that dispute he conducted himself with remarkable clearness and simplicity; and when it was over, sentence was passed upon him and Ridley, who were burnt at the same stake, A.D. 1555.

,,Laud (William),Watkins,"A learned and celebrated prelate, was the son of a clothier at Reading, in Berkshire, and born there in 1573. From Reading school he was removed to St. John's Collegew, Oxford, of which he was elected fellow in 1593. In 1691 he entered into orders, and having opposed the innovations of the puritans, he fell under the displeasure of Dr. Abbot then vice-chancellor, which continued during the life of that divine. His first preferment was the living of Stamford, in Northmaptonshire, and in 1608 he obtained that of North Kilworth in Leicestershire, at whic htime he took the degree of D. D. and became chaplain to Neile, bishop of Rochester. In 1611 he was elected president of his college, and in 1616 preferred to the deanry of Gloucester. The year following he attended king James to Scotland; in 1620 he obtained a prebend of Westminster, and about the same time was made bishop of St. David's. In 1622 he held a conference with Fisher the Jesuit in the presence of the marquis of Buckingham and his mother to confirm them in the protestant relgion. An account of this conference was printed but never answered. At the coronation of Charles I. he officiated as dean of Westminster and in 1626 was translated to the see of Bath and Wells, and in 1628 to London. The university of Oxford in 1630 elected him Chancellor, than whom it never had a more liberal patron. He ornamented St. John's college, erected the building at the end of the divinity-school, founded an Arabic lecture, and gave a collection of MSS. and coins to the university. He succeeded archbishop Abbot in 1633 in the see of Canterbury, and began a work of reformation not more necessary than unpopular. The puritans had increased to an extraordinary degree, and in the church there was a great want of conformity to the liturgy, owing to the laxity of his predecessor. Archbishop Laud not only paid minute attention to the state of the Anglican church, but also to that of Ireland, for which he obtained the impropriations that remained in the hands of the crown. On the breaking out of the rebellion his palace was assaulted by the mob; and in 1640 he was impeached by the house of commons, and sent to the Tower, but not brought to trial till three years after, when he made a most able defence of himself. Though no treason was proved, the house of commons passed an act of attainder against him, which the lords were compelled to confirm. He was beheaded on Tower-hill, January 10, 1644, and his behaviour was calm and intrepid. His corpse was interred in the church of Allhallows, Barking, but afterwards removed to the chapel of St. John's college, Oxford. Archbishop Laud was a man of quick passions, but of strict integrity and unaffected piety. He possessed great learning and extensive abilities, and was the firm friend of the church of England, though the puritans maliciously represented him as inclined to popery.

In 1664 he was admitted M. A. at the former university, and about the same time applied to the study of the Greek philosophers, but having chosen the law for his profession, he took his doctor's degree in that faculty, after which he obtained a post at the court of the elector of Mentz. In 1672 he was at Paris, where he formed an acquaintance with several mathematicians. The year after he visited England, and while here Mr. Collins gave him some hints of sir Isaac Newton's discovery of fluxions, to the merit of which invention Leibnitz afterwards laid claim. The elector of Hanover, George I. employed him in writing the History of the House of Brunswick. In 1700 he was admitted a member of the academy of sciences at Paris, and on the erection of that of Berlin, was appointed perpetual president. In 1711 he was made aulic counsellor to the emperor, and Peter the Great of Russia appointed him privy counsellor of justice, with a pension. Leibnitz was engaged in a controversy at the time of his death in 1716, with Dr. Samuel Clarke, on free-will, space, and other abstruse subjects.

Dudley appears to have indulged the ambitious idea of sharing his sovereign's bed; and to effect it, he is said to have murdered his own wife. In 1564 he was created earl of Leicester. About 1572 he married privately lady Douglas, but never acknowledged her as his wife. However, he had by her a son called Robert, whom he used to call his base son. He afterwards married the countess dowager of Essex, and finding lady Douglas intractable to his proposals of a separation, is said to have taken her off by poison. In 1584 a book was printed, entitled Leicester's Commonwealth, which was a severe attack upon his public and private character.

,,Leo X. (John de Medicis),Watkins,"Was born at Florence, in 1475. At the age of eleven he was made an archbishop by Louis XI. king of France, and at fourteen Julius II. invested him with the dignity of legate, and he served as suth in the army which was defeated by the French near Ravenna, in 1512. He was taken prisoner after that battle; but the soldiers shewed the most superstitious veneration for his person, as the representation of the pope. He was elected to the papacy in 1513, and his coronation was celebrated with unusual pomp. Leo was fond of magnificence, but he had a taste for letters, and liberally patronized men of learning and genius, particularly poets. He terminated the disputes which had subsisted between his predecessor and Louis XII. of France. He concluded the council of Lateran, and formed a splendid library, which he enriched with inestimable manuscripts. A conspiracy was formed against him by the cardinals Petrucci and Sauli, which being discovered, the two principals were condemned to death. Petrucci died in prison, but the other purchased his pardon. Leo formed two great projects, the one to effect a general association of the Christian powers against the Turks, and the other to complete the church of St. Peter. To aid these schemes he issued plenary indulgences, by which the purchasers procured the pardon of their sins. These indulgences being carried into Germany, occasioned the secession from the church of Rome, begun by Luther, whom the pope anathematized in 1520.

,,Louis XI.,Watkins,"Son of Charles VII. by Mary of Anjou, was born in 1423. He distinguished himself by his valour in his youth, particularly against the English, whom he compelled to raise the siege of Dieppe in 1443; but the glory he hereby acquired was tarnished by his rebelling against his father, who died of a broken heart in 1461. Louis on ascending the throne treated France as a conquered country, for which several of the nobility formed a league against him, and some of his own family joined the malcontents. After a severe but indecisive battle at Montlheri in 1465, a peace was concluded, by which Louis gave to the leiguers all their demands; but not fulfilling his engagements the war was rekindled, and he was made prisoner by the duke of Burgundy, who compelled him to make a peace still more disadvantageous than the former. The duke of Berry, brother of the French king, having entered into a treaty of marriage with the daughter of the duke of Burgundy, was poisoned together with his mistress, by the king's almoner: to avenge this murder the duke of Burgundy marched into Picardy, which he ravaged with fire and sword. In 1474 the duke formed a league with Edward IV. king of England, and the king of Brittany, against Louis, who, by negotiation, contrived to disengage the English monarch from the alliance, by a treaty at Amiens in 1475. The duke of Burgundy was, in consequence, obliged to conclude a peace for nine years. Louis had next a war with the emperor Ferdinand III. who had espoused the only daughter of the duke of Burgundy, which ended without any great advantage on either side in 1482. A horrible melancholy seized upon the king of France, who shut himself up from the sight of his subjects, and died in 1483.",,,,1483.0,d.,81.0,,d.

,,Louis XIV.,Watkins,"Was only five years old on the death of his father: the regency was in the hands of the queen-mother, Anne of Austria, under whom Mazarine acted as prime minister. The nation was then involved in a war with Spain and the emperor, which was maintained with glory to the French arms by the prince of Conde and the famous Turenne. France pushed her conquests into Flanders, Artois, Lorraine, and Catalonia. The Swedes, who were in alliance with Louis, gained a great victory over the imperialists in Bohemia; Turenne took Treves and re-established the elector; Conde gained the battle of Northlingen, took Fumes and Dunkirk, and defeated the archduke on the plains of Sens in 1648, after reducing Ypres. The Spanish fleet was defeated on the coast of Italy by the French. This year a separate peace was made between Louis, Ferdinand III. Christina queen of Sweden and the states of the empire. By this treaty Metz, Toul, Verdun, and Alsace were attached to France; but while Louis was successful abroad his kingdom was distracted by internal divisions: the Parisians, irritated against Mazarine and the queenmother, and set on by the duke de Beaufort and the prince of Conde, took up arms; and the king, his mother, and the cardinal were obliged to fly. The Spaniards, profiting by these troubles, made several conquests in Champagne, Lorraine, and Italy. In 1651 the king assumed the government, but Mazarine returning to power the year following, the civil war was renewed: Conde beaded the malcontents, and defeated the marshal d'Hocquincourt at Blenau, but soon afterwards he was attacked by the royal army and made prisoner. In the mean while the archduke Leopold took from the French, Gravelines and Dunkirk; Don John of Austria made himself master of Barcelona, as did the duke of Mantua, of Casal; but domestic tranquillity being restored, these losses were repaired, and Turenne gained several battles, and took a number of places, which produced a peace between France and Spain in 1648: The principal article in this treaty was the marriage of the king with the infanta Maria Theresa. The superintendant Foucquet, being condemned to banishment for peculation, was succeeded by Colbert, one of the ablest ministers and financiers that ever lived; arts and commerce were cherished and flourished; foreign colonies were established; and at home was founded the academy of sciences and another of painting and sculpture. On the war breaking out between England and Holland, Louis joined with the latter, but after a few naval actions the peace of Breda was concluded in 1667. On the death of Philip IV. father of the queen, Louis laid claim to the vacant throne, and marched into the Low countries, where he took a number of towns, particularly Lisle; his progress gave such alarm, that a treaty was entered into between England, Holland, and Sweden, to check his ambition, but just as the treaty was completed, peace was restored between Louis and Spain. In 1672 the French king made an attack on Holland, and reduced some of the provinces in a few weeks: This invasion produced a new confederacy against Louis, between the emperor, Spain, and the elector of Brandenburg, in which all the allies were unsuccessful, and which terminated, in 1678, by the treaty of Nimeguen. The Algerines having committed great depredations, a fleet was sent against them under the command of Du Quesne, who bombarded Algiers and reduced the dey to submission. Louis next avenged himself upon Genoa for selling powder to the Algerines: On this occasion the doge and four senators repaired to Versailles to sue for peace. Amidst all his glory, Louis committed an act of impolitic cruelty by the revocation of the edict of Nantes, granted by Henry IV. in favour of the protestants. This measure drove from France a vast number of ingenious mechanics and others, who settled in England and Holland. About this time another league was formed against France by the prince of Orange, the duke of Savoy, and the electors of Bavaria and Brandenburg. To this league were afterwards added the emperor of Germany and the king of Spain. The dauphin had the command of the French army, and he opened the campaign by taking Philipsburg in October 1688, but he was soon forced to retreat before a superior force. In 1690 the French were more successful: Luxemburg gained the battle of Fleurus, and Catinat took Nice, and gained a victory over the troops of the duke of Savoy; this was followed by the taking of Monsin Flanders, Valence in Catalonia, Carmanole and Montmelian in Savoy. These successes were counterbalanced by the defeat of Tourville's squadron off La Hogue, by admiral Russel, June 2, 1692. Louis in person took Namur, and Luxemburg gained the battles of Steenkirk and Nerwinde. In 1626 Savoy made a separate peace with France, which was followed by a general one at Ryswick in 1697. The tranquillity of Europe, however, was again broken by the death of Charles II. king of Spain, in 1700: He left his crown to Philip of France, duke of Anjou, who assumed the title of Philip V. In opposition to him the archduke Charles laid claim to the throne; and he was supported by the emperor of Germany, Holland, and England. Prince Eugene had the command of the Imperial forces, with which he took Cremona. In 1704 Eugene and Marlborough gained the great battle of Hochstet; the year following Nice and Ville-Franche were taken by the French, who also gained a dear victory at Cassane over Eugene; on the other hand, Barcelona surrendered to the archduke, and Gironne declared in his favour; the battle of Ramilies was gained by the duke of Marlborough, and prince Eugene saved Turin by defeating the duke of Orleans. In. 1708 Lisle was re-taken by the allies, who also gained the battle of Oudenarde, and the Imperialists made themselves masters of Naples. The year following the French lost Tournay, and suffered a defeat at Malpluquet. In 1713 a treaty of peace was signed at Utrecht by France; Spain, England, Savoy, Portugal, Prussia, and Holland; and the next year peace was concluded with the emperor of Radstadt Louis died September 1, 1715, aged 77: by his first wife he had issue one son, Louis, dauphin of France, who died in 1711, leaving three sons, Louis, Philip, and Gaston, Louis XIV. had several illegitimate children by his mistresses.

A reconciliation afterwards took place between them, and Louis, by the persuasions of St Bernard, engaged in a crusade, but was defeated by Saladin, and on his return to Europe he was taken at sea by the Greeks, and delivered by the general of Roger, king of Sicily. His wife Eleanor, the heiress of Guienne and Poitou, who had been the companion of his romantic expedition, committed adultery with her uncle Raymond of Antioch, and afterwards with a young Turk named Saladin, for which she was divorced from Lewis; who took for his second wife the daughter of Thibault, count of Champagne. Eleanor married Henry of Normandy, afterwards king of England, to whom she brought as her dower the provinces of Poitou and Guienne. This produced a new war between England and France; which lasted, with a little intermission, twenty-one years. Louis died in 1180, aged 60.",,,,1180.0,d.,81.0,,d.

Being restored to health he spent four years in preparing for this expedition and in 1248 he embarked for the East with a great force, leaving his kingdom to the care of his mother. After taking Damietta he passed the Nile in view of the Saracens, and obtained two great victories over them. At length famine and disease attacked his army, and the king with his nobles fell into the hands of the infidels. Louis, to recover his liberty, consented to pay a large ransom, to deliver up Damietta, and to conclude a truce for ten years. After spending four years in Palestine he returned to France where, in 1269 he established the liberty of the Galilean church by a pragmatic sanction. In 1270 he undertook another expedition against the infidels, but died in his camp before Tunis in Africa, August 25, the same year. He was canonized in 1297.",,,,1270.0,d.,81.0,,d.

,,Locke (John),Watkins,"A celebrated philosophee, was born at Wrington, in Somersetshire, in 1632, and educated at Westminster school, from whence he removed to Christ-church, Oxford, of which he became student. After taking his degrees in arts, he entered on the study of physic, in which he made great proficiency. Lord Ashley, afterwards earl of Shaftesbury, became his patron and urged him to apply to the study of politics. Mr. Locke followed his advice, and rendered himself serviceable to his lordship and his party; who, having obtained the grant of Carolina, employed him in drawing up the constitution for the government of that province. Lord Shaftesbury being appointed chancellor in 1672, made Mr. Locke secretary of presentations, which place he lost the year following, when his patron was deprived of the great seal. He continued, however, his secretaryship of the board of trade, of which lord Shaftesbury was president. In 1674 that commission was dissolved, and Mr. Locke being in an ill state of health went to Montpellier, and continued abroad tiil 1679, when he was sent for by lord Shaftesbury who was appointed president of the council; but in 1682 that nobleman, to avoid a prosecution for high treason withdrew to Holland, and was accompanied by his friend. In 1684 Mr. Locke was removed from his students place at Christ church, by the king's command; and the year following the English envoy demanded him of the states of Holland, on suspicion of his being concerned in Monmouth's rebellion, which occasioned him to keep private several months, during which he was employed in finishing his Essay on Human Understanding, which however was not published till after the Revolution, when he returned to England, and was made commissioner of appeals. In 1695 he was appointed one of the commissioners of trade and plantations, and he might have had other preferment, but the state of his health led him to decline the advantageous offers that were made him. He spent the later years of his life in Essex, the seat of sir Francis and lady Masham, who invited him to reside in their family. Mr. Locke lived in as much ease as if the house had been his own: he found besides in lady Masham a friend and companion exactly suited to his taste; a lady of contemplation and studious turn, and particularly inured from her youth to deep and refined speculations in theology, metaphysics and morality: he had the additional satisfaction of seeing her only son bred up on the plan which he had laid down as the best method of education, the success of which seemed to sanction his judgment in the choice of that method. He published his letters on Toleration, to promote the scheme which king William had so much at heart, of a comprehension with the dissenters. This drew him into a controversy which was scarcely ended, when he entered into another in defence of his Essays; but the asthma, his constitutional disease, increasing with his years, began to subdue him, and he became so inferior, that 1700 he resigned his seat at the board of trade. He could no longer hear the air of London, so as to insure a regular attendance. After this resignation he continued altogether at Oates, devoting himself to study particularly of the scriptures. In this retirement he also wrote several of his works, and died there in 1704. His remains were interred in the church of Oates, where a monument has been erected to his memory. His principal works are, an Essay on Human Understanding, 2 vols. 8vo.; Letters on Toleration, 4to.; Treatise on Civil Government, 8vo; and Thoughts concerning Education, 12mo.

He was related to Plutarch, and spent the early part of his life in travelling, after which he settled at Athens, where he taught the Platonic philosophy and rhetoric with great reputation, but was called from thence by Zenobia queen of Palmyra, to tutor to her children. He soon gained an uncommon share of her esteem, she spent the leisure hours of her life in his conversation, and modelled her sentiments and conduct by his instructions. The queen was then at war with the emperor Aurelian, and being defeated by him near Antioch, was compelled to shut herself up in Palmyra. The emperor summoned her to surrender, and she returned an answer, drawn up by Longinus, which filled him with anger: he laid siege to the city, winch was surrendered to him, A. D. 278. The queen and Longinus endeavoured to fly into Persia, and were unhappily overtaken and made prisoners. The queen, intimidated, laid the blame of vindicating the liberty of her country on its true author, and the brave Longinus, to the disgrace of the conqueror, was carried away to immediate execution.

,,"Lupus, Servatus",Aikin,"a French abbot in the ninth century, celebrated for his learning, eloquence, and piety, was descended from a considerable family in the diocese of Sens, and born about the commencement of the century. After having received a learned education, he embraced the ecclesiastical life in the abbey of Ferrieres, under Alaric ur Aldric, who was then abbot, and afterwards archbishop of Sens. About the year 828 he went from this monastery to the abbey of Fulda, in Germany, where he studied the Scriptures under the celebrated Rabanus, who at his request composed his ""Commentaries upon the Epistles of St. Paul."" Lupus, who was yet only a deacon, ably profited by the instructions of this learned man, and returned to France in the year 836, with a high reputation for his proficiency in scriptural knowledge. Soon afterwards he was introduced to the empress Judith, who presented him to the emperor Lewis the Debonfiaire, at whose court he continued for some time, in the expectation of preferment. In the year 842, he was fixed upon by Charles the Bald to supersede Odo in the abbacy of Ferrieres, whom that prince was determined to deprive of his monastery, on account of his having embraced the party of Lotharius. Odo, however, resisted his taking possession, till compelled by imperial power to quit the field. In the year 844, Lupus assisted at the council of Verneuil, and was selected to draw up the canons of the council. He also assisted at other assemblies of the French bishops, particularly at the council of Soissons, in 853. Some time before the year 855, he was sent ambassador from Charles the Bald to pope Leo IV.; and that prince afterwards gave him a commission, jointly with the celebrated Prudentius, to reform all the monasteries in France. These two illustrious characters were zealous defenders of St. Augustine's doctrine of grace. The time of his death is uncertain; but he was living at the close of the year 861, and maintained a high reputation, not only for his extensive acquaintance with profane and general literature, but for his knowledge of the doctrine and discipline of the church, of the writings of the Latin fathers, and his extraordinary sanctity of manners. A collection has been made of 130 of his ""Letters,"" upon different subjects, relating to difficulties in grammar, civil and ecclesiastical affairs, points of doctrine, discipline and morals; which are written with solidity, correctness, and elegance, and throw considerable light on the history of the period in which he lived. They were first published by Papirius Masson in 1588, in an octavo volume, and afterwards, in a much more correct state, by Andrew du Chesne, in the third volume of his ""Collection of French Historians."" There are also still extant, by Lupus, ""A Book of the three Questions,"" relating to free will, predestination, and the redemption by the blood of Christ, written against Godeschalc; two ""Letters,"" one to Charles the Bald, and another to Hincmar, bishop of Rheims, first published by father Sirmond in 1648; ""The Life of St. Wigbert, Abbot of Fritzlar;"" and ""The Life of St. Maximin, Bishop of Treves,"" published by Busaeus, in 1602. In 1664, M.

,,Luther (Martin),Watkins,"The great reformer, was born at Isleben in Saxony, of mean parentage, in 1483, In 1501 he was sent to the university of Erfurt, where he studied philosophy and the civil law, but walking one day in the fields with a fellow-student, his companion was struck dead with lightning, which so affected Luther, that he determined to retire from the world. He accordingly went into a monastery of the order of St. Augustine, where he led a pious and studious life; and happening to meet with a Latin bible in the monastery, he read it with the utmost care and avidity, and was struck with the manifest difference between the doctrines of the Gospel and the practices of the Roman church. This impression became deeper in 1512, when he went to Rome on some business belonging to his monastery. On his return he was created DD. and became professor of divinity at the university of Wittemberg, then founded by Frederic elector of Saxony. In 1517 Leo X. published plenary indulgences for all sins committed by those who should purchase them. These pardons were sold in Germany by the dominicans in the most shameful manner, and gave offence to all religious persons, and to Luther in particular, who published a Thesis on Indulgences at Wittemberg, in which he exposed in the strongest manner the iniquity of this odious traffic. The propositions of Luther's Thesis were opposed by Tetzel, the papal agent; but the people at large were convinced that the truth lay on the side of Luther. The dispute growing serious throughout Germany, the emperor earnestly pressed the pope to exert his influence to put a stop to it; and accordingly Luther was cited to appear at Rome, which he prudently declined. Leo also demanded of the elector Frederic to deliver Luther up to the papal legate, which he refused; at the same time requesting that the cause might be heard in Germany. To this the pope consented, and Luther appeared before the cardinal Cajetan, at Augsburg, to whom he gave a full account of his faith, but being required to make an implicit submission to the decrees of the pope, he zealously refused. On this Leo issued a brief, threatening to excommunicate all who should presume to deny his power to grant plenary indulgences. Luther on the other hand appealed in a public declaration front the pope to a general council. The followers of Luther encreased rapidly. Erasmus approved of his Conduct in a great measure, and corresponded with him, but had not the courage to declare himself fully. The learned and amiable Melancthon attached himself firmly to Luther, and by his prudence and moderation rendered him essential service. In 1519 Luther had a dispute at Leipsic with Eccius, professor at Ingoldstadt. In 1520 the pope issued a formal condemnation of Luther, who immediately wrote book, in which he called it ""the execrable bull of Antichrist;"" and calling the students of Wittemberg together, he flung the pope's bull and decretals into the fire. The year following he attended the diet of Worms, by virtue of a safe-conduct from the emperor, and when his friends endeavoured to dissuade him from going, by urging the case of Huss, he said, that ""If there were as many devils at Worms as tiles upon the houses he would go."" He was here required to retract his opinions, and to promise submission to the pope, both which he resolutely refused. On his return through a wood he was seized by a patty of horse, who conveyed him to a castle belonging to the elector of Saxony, where he was secretly kept, that no one knew what was become of him except the persons concerned in the affair. In the mean time the emperor Charles V. published an edict against him, and put under the ban of the empire those who should defend him. Luther, however, was secure in his retreat, which He called his Hermitage and his Paunos; and employed his time in conferences with his chosen friends, and in writing books. After an absence of ten months he made his appearance again at Wittemberg, where he wrote a severe and uncourtly reply to Henry VIII. of England, who had published a book against him on the doctrine of the eucharist. About this time he published a translation of the New Testament into German, which was universally read, though proscribed by imperial authority. In 1524 Erasmus was prevailed on to write against Luther, and chose for his subject the freedom of the human will, which he defended against our reformer, who replied in a treatise entitled, DeServio Arbi trio, which was answered by Erasmus in another, called Hyperaspistes. In 1525 Luther married Catherine de Bore, a nun, who had escaped from a convent, on which his enemies accused him of immorality and impiety, but Luther defended his act on scriptural grounds. In 1529 the emperor convened a diet at Spires, to procure aid from the German princes against the Turks, and to devise means for allaying religious disputes. In this assembly it was ordered that the mass should he universally observed throughout the empire. Against this decree the electors of Saxony and Brandenburg and other princes entered their protest, on which account the reformed party acquired the name of protestants. These princes then entered into a league for their mutual defence against the emperor. In 1530 was drawn up by Melancthon the confession of Augsburg, which was received as the standard of the protestant faith in Germany. In 1535 Luther's translation of the bible into German was published. In 1537 an assembly for religious affairs was held at Smalcald, at which Luther and Melancthon were present. At this meeting Luther was seized with so severe a fit of the stone, that his life was despaired of. He however recovered, and went on writing books, and labouring to promote the great work for which be was raised up by Providence. He died at Isleben in 1546, and his remains were interred with great solemnity at Wittemberg. By his wife Catherine de Bore, who died in 1552, he had three sons, and several of his descendants were living latterly in Germany. The mind of Luther was ardent and impetuous, but honest, and earnestly bent to the discovery and propagation of religious truth. His manners were becoming his profession, and his whole life evinced a zeal for the glory of God, and the welfare of man. His works were collected into seven vols,. folio, at Wittemberg, alter his death.",,,,1546.0,d.,82.0,D,d.

With a very inferior force he completely routed them, for which a pyramid was erected to his honour. But he tarnished the glory of his victories by the basest cruelties to the vanquished, especially the women. Plutarch reports that, having experienced some disadvantages in contending with the Cimbri, he was warned in a dream to avert the wrath of the gods by sacrificing his daughter Calpurnia, which inhuman direction he obeyed.

,,Churchill (John),Watkins,"Duke of Marlborough, and prince of the Roman empire, was the son of the above, and born at Ashe, in Devonshire, in 1650. He received but an indifferent education, for his father took him to court at the age of twelve years, where he became page to the duke of York, and in 1666 obtained a pair of colours in the guards. His first service was at the siege of Tangier; and, at his return to England, he became the favourite of the duchess of Cleveland, who gave him 5000/ with which he purchased an annuity for life. He served afterwards under the great Turenne, who was pleased with his person and bravery, as to call him the handsome Englishman. He distinguished himself so gallantly at the siege of Maestricht, that the king of France publicly thanked him at the head of the regiment. On his return to England he was made lieutenant colonel, gentleman of the bed-chamber, and master of the robes to the duke of York. He attended that prince to Holland and Scotland, and about this time married Miss Jennings, maid of honour to princess, afterwards queen Anne. In 1632 he was shipwrecked with the duke of York, in their passage to Scotland, on which occasion his royal highness expressed the utmost anxiety to save his favourite. The same year he was made a peer, by the title of baron Eymouth in Scotland; and when James came to the crown, he was sent to France to notify the event. In 1685 he was created lord Churchill of Sandridge. The same year he supprescd Monmouth's rebellion, and took him prisoner. He continued to serve king James with great fidelity, till the arrival of the prince of Orange, and then left him, for which he has been stigmatized by several writers, and perhaps not unjustly, with base ingratitude. His own apology was a regard for the religion and constitution of his country. King William created him earl of Marlborough in 1689, and appointed him commander in chief of the English, army in the Low Couutries. He next served in Ireland and reduced Cork, with other strong places, But in 1692 he was suddenly dismissed from his employments, and committed to the Tower; from whence, however, he was soon released. The cause of this disgrace has never been clearly explained. After the death of queen Mary he was restored to favour; and at the close of that reign he had the command of the English forces in Holland, and was appointed ambassador extraordinary to the states, who chose him captain general of their forces. On the commencement of queen Anne's reign he recommended a war with France and Spain, which advice was adopted. In the first campaign of 1702 he took a number of strong towns, particularly Liege. He returned to England the following winter, and received the thanks of both houses, and the honour of a dukedom from the queen. In 1701 he joined prince Eugene, with whom he fought the French and Bavarians at Hochstedt, and obtained a complete victory, taking marshal Tallard prisoner. Just before this he had been created a prince of the empire. In the winter he returned to England, bringing with him the marshal Tallard, and 26 other officers of rank, 121 standards, and 179 colours. He again received the thanks of parliament, and the grant of the manor of Woodstock, with the hundred of Wotton. May 12, in 1706, he fought the famous battle of Ramilies, in which his life was frequently in the most imminent danger, a cannon-shot taking off the head of colonel Bingly, as he was helping the duke to remount. This victory accelerated the fall of Louvain, Brussels, and other important places. He arrived in England in November, and received fresh honours and grants from the queen and parliament. A bill was passed to settle the titles upon the male and female issue of his daughters; and Blenheim house was ordered to be built to perpetuate his gallant actions. He had also a pension of 5000/. a year granted him out of the post office. The following campaign presented nothing worth recording; but the ensuing one was pushed with such vigour, that the French king was glad to enter into a negociation for peace, which, however, had no effect. In 1709 he defeated marshal Villars at Malplaquet; for which victory a general thanksgiving was solemnized. In the winter of 1711 he returned to England, having added considerably to his laurels; but soon after was dismissed from his employments. To add to this unjust treatment, a prosecution was commenced against him for applying the public money to his private purposes. Stung at this, ingratitude, he went into voluntary banishment, accompanied by his duchess, and remained abroad till 1714, when he landed at Dover, amidst the acclamations of the people. Queen Anne was just dead, and her successor restored the duke to his military appointments; but his infirmities increasing, he retired from public employment; and died at Windsor lodge, having survived his intellectual faculties, in 1722. His remains were interred with great pomp in Westminster abbey. The he duke had four daughters, who married into the first families of the kingdom. His duchess outlived him several years.

,,Mary Stuart,Watkins,"The daughter of James V. king of Scotland, by Maria of Lorraine, was born in 1542. She was only eight days old when her father died, on which she became heiress to the throne. Henry VIII. of England endeavored to unite the two kingdoms by a marriage between his son Edward and the infant queen of Scots, but his offer being rejected, he sent his troops into Scotland, where they took and plundered Edinburgh, but were soon obliged to return. In 1548 Mary was contracted to Francis dauphin of France, at which court she acquired those accomplishments which rendered her an object of universal admiration, and there also she imbibed those prejudices which proved the force of her misfortunes. In 1558 the marriage was celebrated, and by the direction of their father in-law Mary and her husband assumed the title of king and queen of England, on the supposed ground of the illegitimacy of Elizabeth, an act of ridiculous ambition, which was afterwards fatal to Mary. In 1559 Henry II. died, and Francis became king of France, but in less than two years he left Mary a widow, on which she returned to her native country, and was received by her subjects with joy. Scotland was at this time a prey to fanatical zeal. The presbyterian party carried reformation to shocking lengths, by destroying abbeys, cathedrals, libraries, and even the monuments of the dead. Such was the state of the kingdom at the landing of Mary, who, the first Sunday after her arrival, ordered mass to be said in her chapel. This gave great offense to the people, and it was with difficulty they granted to their sovereign that liberty of conscience which they claimed themselves. Mary shewed a different temper, for she proclaimed that any attempt towards a change or subversion of the reformed church, should be treated as a capital offense. Notwithstanding this liberality on her part, the people in every pageant and spectacle, delighted to insult the queen by ridiculing her religion. Even the royal chapel was assaulted by the mob, at the instigation of Knox the reformer. Several otters of marriage were made to Mary, who rejected them, and bestowed her hand on Henry Lord Darnley, son of the earl of Lennox, a young nobleman of prepossessing appearance, but weak and impetuous in his mind and temper, and mean and intemperate in his habits. This inauspicious marriage soon ended in disgust, and the enemies of both took the advantage of widening the breach. They persuaded Darnley that David Rizzio, an old Italian musician, whom the queen had appointed her foreign secretary, had supplanted him in her affections. A conspiracy was formed, and one night, while the queen was at supper with the countess of Argyle, Henry conducted his confederates to the royal apartment, where Rizzio was murdered in the presence of Mary, who was then advanced in her pregnancy. James Hepburn, earl Bothwell, became now a favorite in the court of Scotland; a man of considerable intrigue, but of unprincipled conduct. By his arts he gained an ascendancy over the mind of Mary, who appointed him lieutenant of the marches. In 1566 she was delivered of a son, afterwards James VI. of Scotland, and the first of England. Darnley in the meantime feeling himself deprived of power, and generally despised, retired to his country house, which was blown up one night, and the body of the king found in a garden adjoining, without any marks of violence.This deed of darkness occasioned universal horror, and as it left no doubt that Bothwell was the principal cause, so it drew on Mary suspicions which were never effaced till our own days. After a mock trial Bothwell was acquitted, and he was strengthened in the power he had acquired. He now laid aside the mask, and on the 24th of April, 1567, seized the queen, and carried her to the castle of Dunbar, where by entreaties and force he prevailed on her to marry him. This is the great stain on the character of this ill-fated woman, which has called forth the utmost exertions of her enemies and her advocates. The conduct of Bothwell towards her after this, in keeping her a prisoner under a strong guard, does certainly carry strong presumption that she was forced into this union against her own inclination. A confederacy of the most powerful lords, in the kingdom, was formed against Bothwell, who finding himself unable to oppose them, left the kingdom, and died miserably in Denmark. Mary was committed to the charge of her greatest enemy, the mother of the earl of Murray, who had assumed the title or regent, and the lords of the confederacy forced the queen to sign a renunciation of her crown in favor of her son, and he was accordingly crowned at Stirling. After this, the enemies of Mary, who had suffered Bothwell to quit the kingdom, caused different persons to be executed for being concerned in the king's murder. All these solemnly acquitted Mary of being privy to that transaction. Notwithstanding this, the council, for the purpose of rendering her odious, and coloring their own tyranny, produced letters, purporting to be written by her, which if true, would clearly establish the fact. But they have been proved forgeries. Mary having escaped from her prison in the ifland of Lochleven, haftened to Hamilton, where she found many friends, but the regent Murray marching against them the royal party was defeated. On this Mary fled into England, where she implored the protection of Elizabeth, who acted with great duplicity for some time, and at length declared that no assistance could be afforded her unless she submitted to a legal trial. After some difficulties this was agreed to, and the cause was to be determined at York by a commission, which finally, removed to London, where it was declared, that ""nothing had been produced whereby the queen of England could conceive or take any evil opinion of her good sister, for any thing yet seen."" This is a sufficient vindication of Mary's innocence, and yet she was still kept in close confinement. The duke of Norfolk formed the design of marrying Mary, in which he was encouraged by several of the English nobility, and also by the regent Murray. But this being discovered by Elizabeth, the duke was sent to the Tower, from whence he was not released till he promised to renounce all correspondence with the queen of Scotland:—but afterwards, renewing his ambitious project, he was tried and executed. After a long confinement at Coventry, Mary was removed to Fotheringay castle, where she was to undergo the mock formality of a trial on the charge of fomenting conspiracies against Elizabeth. When brought before the commissioners she disclaimed their authority, and asserted her innocence. The commissioners, after hearing her defense, removed the matter to Westminster, and, though no proof appeared of the charges, she was declared guilty of conspiring the death of Elizabeth. Mary received the tidings with complacency, being wearied by her unparalleled persecutions. Many foreign powers interested themselves in her behalf, and her son James endeavored to save her life, but in vain. A warrant was sent down, and read to the royal captive, who only entreated that she might be permitted the consolations of her own religion. Even this favor was inhumanly refused. She was beheaded in the castle of Fotheringay, Feb. 3, 1587, after praying to God to forgive all who had thirsted for her blood. Thus fell Mary Stuart, a princess of uncommon beauty and accomplishments as well as misfortunes. Her remains were interred in Peterborough cathedral, from whence they were removed by her son, and deposited in Westminster abbey.

At the invitation of the prince of Prussia, afterwards Frederick the Great, he went to Berlin in 1740, and was appointed president and director of the academy. He accompanied that king in his campaigns against the Austrians, but exposing himself too much at the battle of Molwitz, he was made prisoner and sent to Vienna, where he was well received by the emperor.

He made a rapid progress in his studies at the univeriitv ot Heidelberg, from whence he removed to Tubingen, where he continued six years. In 1518 he obtained the Greek professorship at Wittemberg, where he formed a close friendship with Luther, whose opinions he defended both in his public lectures and by his writings. In 1527 the elector of Saxony appointed him to visit the churches in his territories; but his greatest labour was in drawing up the Augsburg Confession of Faith. His learning and moderation spread his fame through Europe, and the kings of France and England invited him to their kingdoms, with flattering offers, which he declined. In the progress of the reformation he exhibited a different temper from Luther, being more cautious and timid, on which account he was often reproved by him in severe terms. The prudence of Melancthon, however, was of important service, and tended confiderably to the propagation ot the protestant doctrines, by guarding them from the abuses of intemperate zeal. In 1559 Melancthon assifted in the conferences at Spires, and in his journey thither visited his mother, a pious woman, who asked him what he whould believe, and how she should pray amid these religious disputes, at the same time repeating her simple creed and form of devotion. ""Continue,"" said her son, ""to believe and to pray as you do at present, and do not trouble yourself about controversies.""

In 1724 Dr. Middleton was in Italy, and having a near observation of the ecclesiastical pomp and ceremonies, he wrote his famous letter from Rome, to show that the religious rites of the Roman church were drawn from the heathens. An attack on Dr. Waterland's Vindication of the Scripture in 1730, drew upon Middleton the charge of infidelity, and he narrowly escaped academical censure. The year following he was appointed Woodwardian professor, but resigned that place in 1734. In 1741 appeared his Life of Cicero, in 2 vols. 4to.; afterwards reprinted in 3 vols. 8vo. This is a very curious and valuable work, and highly necessary towards forming a just idea of the character and writings of that great man, as well as exhibiting an exact picture of the Roman republic in his time. In 1743 Dr. Middleton published the Epistles of Cicero to Brutus, and those of Brutus to Cicero, in Latin and English, with a vindication of their authenticity. In 1747 appeared his Discourse on the Miraculous Powers supposed to have subsisted in the Christian Church from the earliest ages, 4to. This performance gave great alarm to the clergy, and numerous answers were written against it. Middleton died in 1750; and in 1752 appeared all his works, with the exception of the Life of Cicero, in 4 vols. 4to. His style is admirable, and his learning was profound and multifarious; but from his letters to lord Hervey it is evident that he was sceptical in his religious opinion.",,,,1750.0,d.,86.0,D,d.

,,Milton (John),Watkins,"An illustrious poet, was the son of a scrivener in London, and born in Bread-street in 1608. From St Paul's school he went to Christ's college. Cambridge, where he took his degrees in arts, being designed for the church; but not having an inclination to that calling, he returned to his father, who had retired from business with a good fortune, and settled at Horton in Buckinghamshire. Here our poet wrote his Comus, L' Allegro, Il Penferoso, and Lycidas, poems of such merit as would alone have immortalized his name. In 1638 he travelled into France and Italy, where he was greatly caressed by people of the highest rank and talents. On his return to England he settled in London, and undertook the tuition of some youths, for which profession he appears by his Tractate on Education to have been well calculated. The troubles breaking out between the king and parliament, Milton engaged as a political writer on the popular side; and having a great animosity to the hierarchy, he published some virulent pamphlets against the bishops. In 1613 he married the daughter of a justice of peace in Oxfordshire; but his wife having been brought up with different sentiments from her husband, and disapproving of his zeal, eloped from him and returned to her friends. The impetuosity of Milton's temper carried him into an opinion that this furnished him with a sufficient reason for taking another wife. He accordingly published some tracts on divorce, to vindicate this notion; which he was about to carry into effect, when his wife's frends brought about a reconciliation. He continued an ardent champion for the rebellious party, even after the murder of Charles I., which sanguinary deed he defended with his pen againft Salmasius; but he was not disinterested in this, for the parliament rewarded him with one thousand pounds. He also wrote with great asperity against the king's book of prayers and meditations, entitled, the Icon Basilike. About this time he was wholly deprived of his sight, owing to a natural weakness, and an intense application to his studies. In 1632 he lost his wife, and soon afterwards took another. Though he was a determined republican, and wrote with energy and intemperance against monarchical government, ""the very trappings of which,"" he said, ""would support a commonwealth,"" yet he readily fubmitted to the usurpation of Cromwell, to whom he became Latin secretary. Milton endeavoured to prevent the restoration; which event he had undoubted cause to dread, considering the adsive part taken by him in the rebellion. And when the ancient consitution was reestablished, he was excepted out of the aft of indemnity, on which he kept himself concealed for some time. By the kindness, however, of sir William Davenant, and others, he obtained his pardon; Soon alter which he lost his second wife and was not long without another. In the time of the plague he removed with his family to Chalsont, in Buckinghamshire, where he completed his Paradise Lost, which was printed first in 1667. For this immortal work he had only fifteen pounds, and that by instalments. For the idea of it he is said to have been indebted to an Italian drama on the Fall of Man; and it is certain that he had himself an intention at first of writing only a tragedy on the same subject. As the work grew under his hand, his soaring genius gave it the form and confluence, the variety and elegance, of an epic poem. After this he engaged in another called Paradise Regained; the occasion of which was as follows; John Elwood, the quaker, who was his amanuensis, calling upon him at Chalsont, and the conversation turning upon Milton's great work, Elwood observed, ""Thou has said much upon Paradise Lost, but what hast thou to say upon Paradise Found?"" Milton paused, and the next time they met he showed Elwood the latter poem, saying, ""This is owing to you."" The Paradise Regained, though posessing many beauties, is in all respects inferior to the Paradise Lost; yet it is remarkable that the author gave it the preference. Milton died at his house in Bunhill-row in 1674, and lies interred in the parish church ot St. Giles, Cripplegate, where a monument has been erected to his memory, and there is another in Westminster-abbey, set up by auditor Benson. But his best monument is Paradise Lost. This poem was unknown in the poet's lifetime, and many years after. It was not till Mr. Addison gave his admirable critique upon it in the Spectator, that the beauties of it became generally understood, and the whole merits of the poem to be admired. Mr. Dryden, indeed, had given his approbation of the work and his opinion of the author in an excellent epigram, which is usually prefixed to the Paradife Lost, or subjoined to the portrait of the author. Besides this and the other poems mentioned above, Milton wrote a drama on the Greek Model, entitled, Samson Agonistes, which posesses uncommon beauties, though not adapted to theatrical representation. His Comus has been sevcral times performed, and the first time was for the benefit of the author's granddaughter, Mrs Clarke, a widow in reduced circumstances. On that occasion Dr. Samuel Johnson wrote a prologue. The best edition of Milton's poetical works is that of Mr. Todd, in 6 vols. 8vo. The late Mr. Thomas Warton published his smaller poems in one volume, 8vo. enriched with very curious notes. Bishop Newton and Mr. Hayley have written the life of Milton, the first as a biographer and the latter as a poet. Among the prose works of Milton we shall only mention his History of England, 1 vol. 4to. which comes down only to the conquest; and his Areopagitica, in which he pleaded the cause of a free press with great force. The whole of his political works have been printed in 3 vols. folio, and also in quarto and octavo. Of the religion of Milton it is difficult to speak. In his youth he was a calvinist, but afterwards he became inclined to arminianism. From being a presbyterian he turned independant, and lastly he seems to have joined no particular communion. He was, however, a firm believer in the truths of revelation. When at Cambridge he was so handsome as to be called the Lady of Christ's college; and he retained his comeliness to the last. He died in good circumstances. By his first wife he had three daughters, two of whom used to read to him in eight languages, though they understood only their own, it being a usual saying with him that one tongue was enough for a woman.",,,,1674.0,d.,86.0,P,d.

,,Mithridates king of Pontus,Watkins,"Sumamed the Great, succeeded his father at the age of 11 years, B.C. 123. He murdered his mother, who had been left coheiress of the kingdom; and also his two nephews. For his treachery the Roman senate declared war against him, and in revenge he ordered all the Romans in his dominions to be massacred. He then marched with a powerful army against Aquilius, whom he defeated; but Sylla, after some victories, forced Mithridates to make peace B.C. 84. He renewed the war in alliance with Tigranes king of Armenia. After conquering Bithynia, Mithridates laid siege to Cyzicum, in the Propontis; but Lucullus having marched to its relief besieged Mithridates in his camp. The king of Pontus defeated the Romans in two combats, but was completely vanquifhed in a third. Glabrio being sent to supersede Lucullus in the command, this change was advantageous to Mithridates, who recovered the best part of his kingdom. Pompey, however, obtained a great victory over him near the Euphrates, B.C. 65. Mithridates fled to Tigranes, who refused him an asylum. He then sent ambassadors to Pompey to sue for peace, but the Romans insisted upon having his person. The people of Pontus in the mean time proclaimed Pharnaces in the room of his father Mithridates, who put an end to himself, B. C. 64.",,,,-63.0,d.,87.0,,d.

,,Mahomet or Mohammed,Watkins,"A famous impostor, was born in 570, at Mecca, a city of Arabia, of the noble family of Koreish. Losing his father in his infancy, the guardianship of him devolved on his uncle Abu Taleb, who employed him to go with his caravans from Mecca to Damascus. In this employment of camel driver he continued till he was twenty-eight years of age, when he married Cadiga, a rich widow. Becoming hereby one of the wealthiest men in Mecca, he formed the design of obtaining the sovereignty; and judging there was no way so likely to gain his end as by effecting a change in the religion of his countrymen, he suddenly assumed a very fancified appearance. Having remarked in his travels the infinite variety of feats which prevailed, he conceived that his project was not impracticable. He accordingly spent much of his time in a cave near Mecca, seemingly alone, and employed in meditation and prayer, but in reality he called to his aid a Persian jew, well versed in the history and laws of his persuasion, and two Christians, one of the Jacobite and the other of the Nestorian sect. With the help of these men he framed his Koran, or the book which he pretended to have received at different times from heaven by the hands of the angel Gabriel. At the age of forty he publicly assumed the prophetical character, calling himself the apostle of God. At first he had only his wife and eight other followers; but in three years his disciples were considerably numerous. On these he imposed the most marvellous tales, but well adapted to deceive ignorant and superstitious minds. He pretended to have palled into the highest heavens in one night, on the back of a beautiful ass called Al Borak, and accompanied by the angel Gabriel. There he had an interview with Adam, Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus Christ, who acknowledged his superiority, which was confirmed to him by the Deity himself. This romance daggered even some of his best friends, and a powerful confederacy being formed against him, he was forced to quit Mecca, and to seek a refuge in Medina. This retreat occasioned the foundation of his empire, and of his religion. The Mohammedans adopt it as their chronological standard, calling it the Hegira, that Is the Flight or Perfection, being the first day of our July, A. D. 622. Mahomet had still a number of disciples, upon whom he inculcated this principle, that they were not to dispute for their religion by word but by the sword. This was a doctrine well adapted to a lawless and wandering people, and was soon carried into practice by them. The jewish Arabs were the first who experienced its effects. Mahomet committed upon them the most shocking cruelties, put numbers to death, sold others for slaves, and disributed their goods among his soldiers. A faith thus propagated could not but succeed in a country like Arabia, He rewarded his adherents here by plunder, and held out to them a certain happiness of the most sensual kind hereafter. In 627 he made a treaty with the inhabitants of Mecca, which two years afterwards he violated, and stormed the place with fire and sword. Having made himself master of Arabia, he extended his conquests into Syria, where he took several cities, and laid some of the princes under tribute. While engaged in this victorious career, a jewess poisoned a shoulder of mutton which was laid before him, and of which he and his companions ate heartily. One of them died immediately, but the prophet lingered some time. When the woman was examined, she declared that she had perpetrated the deed on purpose to try whether he was really a true prophet. Of the effects of this poison he died, A.D. 632, and of the hegira 8, aged 62. After the death of Cadiga he had several wives and concubines, by whom he had many children, but left only a daughter named Fatima, who married his successor Ali. It is a vulgar error, that the body of Mahomet was laid in a steel coffin, and suspended in his tomb at Medina between two magnets. The Koran of this impostor contains a good deal of practical morality, drawn from the scriptures, but blended with extravagant tales, and blasphemous doctrines. The best printed edition is that of Maracci, in Arabic and Latin, Padua, 2 vols. fol. 1698.

,,Moliere (John Baptiste),Watkins,"A French comic writer, whole real name was Pocqnelin , was born at Paris in 1620. His father, who was a tapetsry maker, intended him for the same business; but young Pocquelin being in the habit of visiting the theatre, conceived a violent inclination for the stage. At the age of fourteen he commenced his studies under the Jesuits, and made a rapid progress in the belles lettres. His father becoming reduced, the youth associated himself with some persons of his own age, who had a like attachment to dramatic representation. It was in consequence of this connexion that he took the name of Moliere; and it is rather remarkable that this custom of changing their names has been common to other actors in France and England. He now joined a company of comedians who acted at Lyons, and in 1653 he produced in the same party his first comedy, called L'Etourdi, or the Blunderer. This piece was received with great applause, and procured him the friendship of the prince de Conti, who had known the author at college. That prince offered to make him his secretary, which honourable station Moliere declined, saying, that, ""though he was a passable author, he should make but a bad secretary."" After performing at various places, the company of Moliere visited Paris, where they performed several of his plays before Louis XI V. who took the company into his own service, and gave their leader a pension. His last piece, the Hypochondriac, or le Malade Imaginaire, occasioned his death, for by his exertions in performing the principal character he was seized with a cunvulsion, of which he died in 1673. The archbishop of Paris refused to allow his remains to be interred in confecrated ground on account of his profeshion, till he was compelled to it by the king. Moliere left a widow, who married a comedian named Guerin, and died in 1723, aged 92. The works of Moliere have been often printed; the best edition is that of Paris in 1772, in 6 vols. 8vo. They have been translated into English; and several of his comedies have been adapted to our stage with success. Moliere is juftiy called the French Aristophanes.",,,Moreri,1672.0,d.,87.0,P,d.

Soon after he was appointed surveyor-general of the works, and chief engineer.

,,Monk (George),Watkins,"Duke of Albemarle, was born of an ancient family at Potheridge, near Torrington in Devonshire, In 1608. Being a younger son, he entered as a volunteer under his elation sir Richard Grenville. On the breaking out of the war between Charles I. and the Scotch in 1639, he obtained a colonel's commission, and attended his majesty in both his expeditions to the north. When the first rebellion began in 1641, he was sent thither, and did such service that the lords justices appointed him governor of Dublin. On his return to England he was sent to relieve Nantwich, where he was taken prifoner by the army belonging to the parliament, by whom he was sent to the Tower, where he remained till 1646, when the royal cause being ruined, he obtained his liberty on condition of taking a command in Ireland, where he concluded a peace with the rebels, which displeased the parliament, who called a vote of censure upon him for it. Cromwell, who thought highly of his military talents, made him lieutenant-general, and gave him the chief command in Scotland. But the sagacious usurper had strong suspicions of Monk's sincerity and not long before his death wrote him a letter to which he added this postscript: ""There be that tell me that there is a certain cunning fellow in Scotland, called George Monk, who is said to lie in wait there to introduce Charles Stuart: I pray you use your diligence to apprehend him and send him up to me."" Monk acted with great caution after the protestor's death, and though he marched into England with a powerful army, no party could guess to which side he inclined. The republican faction courted him, and the royalists were afraid that he intended to set up for himself. Moderate men pressed him to call a free parliament, to which, measure he acceded, as the one most favourable to his own views. This assembly voted the restoration of the king, with whom the general had carried on a secret correspondence;  Thus was this great event brought about by his prudence without bloodshed. Honours were deservedly heaped upon him, and he was equally esteemed both by the king and people. He was created duke of Albemarle with a pension of seven thousand pounds a year, in 1664 he was appointed admiral of the fleet in conjunction with prince Rupert, and obtained a great victory over the Dutch. During the plague in London he continued in the city to the great comfort of the inhabitants, who looked up to him in that awful visitation as their tutelary angel. This great man, whose private virtues were equal to his valour and political talents, died of a dropsy in 1670. His corpse, after lying in state sevetal weeks, was interred in the chapel of Henry VII. in Westminster abbey. He wrote an excellent book, entitled, Observations on Military and Political Affairs, 1671, folio; and a Collection of his Letters was printed in 1715. Though the general was never afraid of a cannon shot, it is said that he stood in fear of his wife, who was the daughter of a blackfmith, and was bred a milliner. She was a bitter enemy of lord Clarendon, and a great mistress of abusive language. She was at first the mistress of Monk, when he was a prisoner in the Tower; and had by him a son, Christopher duke of Albemarle, who died governor of Jamaica in 1688.",,,,1670.0,d.,87.0,,d.

,,Montaigne (Michael de),Watkins,"A celebrated French writer, was born at a seat of that name in Perigord in 1533. He was intended for the bar, but disliking that profession he quitted it, and travelled into different countries, making his observations rather on human nature than places and curiosities. At Rome he was honoured with the citizenship. In 1581 he was chosen mayor of Bourdeaux, in which port he gave such satisfaction as to be elected for four years successively. He appeared with applause at the meeting of the states of Blois in 1588, and was honoured by Charles IX with the order of St. Michael. After an active life he retired to his seat of Montaigne, where he devoted himself to philosophical studies, and died as a Christian in 1592.

,,Montesquieu (Charles de Secondat Baron of),Watkins,"An eminent writer, was born of a noble family near Bourdeaux in 1689. His first literary performance, entitled, Persian Letters, published in 1721, gave proofs of a fine genius, and a solid judgment. The year following he pleaded with so much eloquence against the imposition of a new duty that it was suppressed. In 1728 he was admitted a member of the French academy, though not without opposition from cardinal Fleury, who conceived there were some things dangerous to religion in his Persian Letters. Montesquieu having formed the design of his great work the Spirit of Laws, travelled into Germany and Holland, and lastly to England, where he resided two years, calling this the country for thinking, and France for living. On his return home he published his Treatise on the Causes of the Greatness and Declension of the Romans. In 1748 appeared his Spirit of Laws 2 vols. 4to.; which ought rather to have been termed the Spirit of Nations. In it the author has distinguished three forts of government, the republican, the monarchical, and the despotic, all of which he has examined with so much clearness as to have rendered his work the code of the Law of Nations; and he has himself been called the legislator of the human race. Montesquieu succeeded his uncle as president of the parliament of Bourdeaux, and died in a manner becoming a christian and philosopher in 1755. His Familiar Letters were printed in 1767, in 1 vol. 12mo. His son John Baptiste de Secondat, counsellor of the parliament of Bourdeaux, and a member of the academy of that city, and of the royal society of London, died in 1796, aged 79.

On this Nadir entered into the service of the Beglerbeg, governor of Muschada, in Khorasan, who appointed him to command an army sent against the Tartars. Nadir gained a complete victory with an inferior force, and took the Tartar general prisoner. Beglerbeg at first treated Nadir with great distinction, but being jealous of his aspiring spirit he refused him the rank of lieutenant general which he had promised him; and when Nadir complained of his breach of faith, he caused him to be bastinadoed. Exasperated at this ungrateful and dishonourable treatment, he joined a banditti of robbers. With this troop, consisting of five hundred well mounted men, he committed great ravages. The Afghans having made themselves masters of Ispahan, and the Turks and Muscovites ravaging other parts of Persia, Schah Thamas applied to Nadir for his assistance. He accordingly entered into the service of the Schah, but one of his first actions was to murder his uncle who had usurped his title. He distinguished himself against the Turks, whom he defeated in several actions, for which he was made a general, and the Schah conferred upon him the title of Thamas Kouli, or the slave of Thamas; he was also ennobled with the title of Than. Notwithstanding these distinctions, he deposed Thamas, and placed a son of that prince on the throne, to whom he became regent. In 1735 he gained the battle of Erivan, in which the Turks lost above 50,000 men. After this he assumed the royal title, and was acknowledged by the grandees of the empire.

He was adopted by Claudius in A.D. 50. and four years after succeeded him on the throne. The commencement of his reign promised to be very advantageous to the Romans, who regarded him as a gift from Heaven. He was just, liberal, affable, polished, complaisant, and his heart seemed to possess every excellent quality. But all this was mere exterior, and a mask which hid the most depraved mind that ever disgraced a human being: he soon laid aside his artificial virtues, and released himself from the control of his mother, whom he caused to be assassinated; and vindicated the unnatural and to the senate on a pretence that Agrippina had plotted against him. Many of the Courtiers shared the same fate And Rome was deluged with the blood of her best citizens. Nero plunged himself as deep in debauchery as in cruelty. He disguished himself in female attire, and was publicly married to one of his eunuchs. He turned actor, pretended to excel in music, and even appeared as a competitor in wrestling at the Olympic games, where, though he was defeated, the assessors and spectators, out of flattery, adjudged him the victor. After putting to death his wife Octavia, he sacrificed his tutor Seneca, Lucan the poet, Petronius, and many other eminent persons. He also commenced a dreadful persecution of the Christians; and having read of the burning of Troy, he caused Rome to be set on fire in feveral places, and during the conflagration the inhuman monster beheld the scene from a high tower, where he amused himself by singing to his lyre. After this he built a magnificent palace, and said that he could now lodge like a man. His cruelties, extravagance, and debauchery, at length roused the public resentment. Piso formed a conspiracy against the tyrant, but it was discovered and defeated.

,,Newton (Sir Isaac),Watkins,"The prince of philosophers, was descended of an ancient family in Lincolnshire, and born at Woolstrope, in that county, on Christmas day in 1642. Losing his father in his childhood the care of him devolved on his mother; who gave him an excellent education, though she married a second time. In 1654 he was sent to Grantham school, and at the age of eighteen removed to Trinity college, Cambridge, where he had the learned Mr. (afterwards Dr.) Isaac Barrow for his tutor. Under that able mathematician Mr. Newton made a rapid progress. After going through Euclid's Elements, the most difficult problems in which were very easy and familiar to him, he proceeded to the study of Descartes's geometry, with Oughtred's Clavis, and Kepler's Optics, in all of which he made marginal notes as he went along; and this always continued to be his method of study. It was in this early course that he invented the method of series and fluxions, which he afterwards brought to perfection, though his claim to the discovery was unjuftly contested by Leibnitz, who obtained a knowledge of it in 1676 from the author himself. At the age of twenty-two Mr. Newton took his degree of bachelor of arts, and about the same time he applied to the grinding of optic glasses for telescopes; and having procured a glass prism in order to try the phenomena of colours lately discovered by Grimaldi, the result of his observations was his new theory of light and colours. On the breaking out of the plague in 1665 he retired to his country seat, where, secluded from conversation and books, his active and penetrating mind started that hint which gave rise to his celebrated system of the universe. He was sitting alone in his garden when some apples falling from a tree led his thoughts to the subjest of gravity; and reflecting on the power of that principle, he began to consider that as it is not diminished at the remotest distance from the centre ofthe earth, it may be extended as far as the moon, and to all the planetary bodies. This subject he afterwards resumed on the occasion of the great comet in 1680, and in 1687 the important principle which forms the foundation of the Newtonian philosophy was first published under the title of Philosophia Naturalis principia Mathematica. On our author's return to the university, in 1667, he was chosen fellow of his college, and took his degree of mailer of arts. Two years afterwards he succeeded Dr. Barrow in the mathematical professorship, on which occasion he read a course of optical lectures in Latin. He had not finished them in 1673, when he was chosen fellow of the royal society, to which learned body he communicated his theory of light and colours, which was followed by his account of a new telescope invented by him, and other interesting papers. When the privileges of the univerfity of Cambridge were attacked by James II. Mr. Newton was appointed to appear as one of her delegates in the high-commission court, where he pleaded with so much strength that the king thought proper to stop his proceedings. He was next chosen a member of the convention parliament, in which he sat till it was dissolved. In 1696 he was made warden of the mint, and afterwards mailer of that office; which place he discharged with the greatest honour till his death. On his last promotion he nominated Mr. Whiston to fill his chair at Cambridge with all the profits of the place, and reiigned it entirely to him in 1703. The same year our author was chosen president of the royal society, in which station he continued twenty-five years. He was also a member of the academy of sciences at Paris, having been chosen in 1699. In 1704 he published his treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections, and Colours of Light, which was afterwards tranflated into several languages, and went through many editions. The next year queen Anne conferred on him the honour of knighthood. In the succeeding reign he was very often at court, and the princess of Wales, afterwards queen Caroline, frequently convened with him on philofophical subjects. About 1718 he communicated to her royal highness the outlines of his treatise on ancient chronology, with which she was so pleased that she never would part with it. A surreptitious copy of it was, however, obtained and carried to France by the abbe Conti, who translated and printed it with observations. On this Sir Isaac published a paper on the subject in the Philosophical Transactions, and the work at length in English, in quarto. After enjoying an uncommon share of health, owing to his activity and temperance, till he was fourscore years old, this great man began to be afflicted with an incontinence of urine, which was followed by a stone in the bladder. The last twenty days of his life were attended with much pain, yet amidst the several agonies he never cried out or expressed the slightest impatience. He died March 20th, 1726, and after lying in state in the Jerusalem chamber the body was interred in Westminster abbey, the lord chancellor, the dukes of Montrole and Roxburgh, and three earls, bearin the pall. A stately monument has been erected over his remains at the entrance into the choir. Sir Isaac was of a middling stature, and his countenance was pleasing and venerable. He never made use of spectacles, and during his whole life lost but one tooth. He was of a very meek disposition, and a great lover of peace. To his other great qualities he added a serious. and devout reverence for religion. His favourite study was the Bible; the prophecies of which he illustrated by his researches. He conformed to the church of England, but he lived in friendship with good men of all communions; and he was an enemy to every kind of persecution. Sir Isaac had a great abhorrence of infidelity, and never failed to reprove those who made free with revelation in his presence, of which the following is an instance, The learned Dr. Halley was sceptically inclined, and sometimes took the liberty of sporting with the scrtiptures. On one such occasion Sir Isaac said to him ""Dr. Halley, I am always glad to hear you when you speak about astronomy, or other parts of mathematics, because that is a subject which you have studied, and well understand; but you should not talk of Christtanity, for you have not studied it; I know you know nothing of the matter."" Sir Isaac was never married, and, perhaps, had never time to think of it, being constantly immersed in the profoundest studies, and not being willing to have them broken by domestic concerns. A complete and elegant edition of his works was published with illustrations by Dr. (now bishop) Horsley, in 1779, in five volumes, quarto.",,,,1727.0,d.,89.0,M,d.

From Alexandria he went to Rome, where he began his famous Hexapla, or the Bible in different languages. At the command of his bishop, he returned to Alexandria and was ordained. Soon after this, he began his Commentaries on the Scriptures; but Demetrius, who envied his reputation, persecuted him with violence, and in a council assembled in 231, it was decreed that Origen should desist from preaching and quit the city. On this, he went to Caesarea, where he was well received by the bishop, and permitted to preach, which gave additional offense to his persecutors, who excommunicated him. Though he was thus treated at home, he met with the greatest respect wherever he went.

On settling at Rome, his accomplishments procured him many friends, particularly Augustus, who, however, ordered him to be banished to the banks of the Euxine sea, where he died, A.D. 17.

Some assert that it was for writing his Art of Love; others say, that it was for an intrigue with Livia, the wife of Augustus; and there are those who maintain, that the true cause was Ovid's discovering the emperor's unnatural attachment to his own daughter Julia.

His instructor in the musical science is said to have been one Gaudio Mell, a Fleming, in which name some have recognized Claude Gondimel, a musician of Franche Comté; but the identity of these is a point of uncertainty. Of Giovanni's early life nothing is known; but it appears, that in 1555 he was admitted into the pope's chapel in Rome. He had already formed that simple, grave, and noble style for which he became so famous; for we are told that the pope and conclave having been scandalized at the light and injudicious manner in which the mass had been usually set and performed, had determined to banish music in parts entirely from the church; but that Palestrina, at the age of twenty-six, during the pontificate of Marcellus Cervinus, interceded with his holiness to suspend the sentence till he should have heard a mass composed in a different style. Accordingly, at Easter 1555, he presented before the pope and cardinals his celebrated composition, entitled, ""Missa Papae Marcelli,"" which was heard by them with so much pleasure and admiration, that music in divine service was restored to favour. In 1562 Palestrina was elected chapel-master to the church of Santa Maria-Maggiore; and in 1571 was appointed to the same office at St. Peter's. He opened a school of music at Rome in conjunction with his friend and fellow-pupil Gio. Maria Nanino, and greatly contributed to establish the superior reputation of the Italian musicians. He died in 1594, and was interred at St. Peter's, whither his funeral was attended by all the musicians at Rome, and a great concourse of other persons. His own composition, ""Libera nos Domine,"" was performed on the occasion. No musician has been mentioned with more honour by writers on the same science than Palestrina, who was undoubtedly a great and original genius. Although the inventions of fugue, canon, and other elaborate compositions, have been banished from dramatic music, they have been retained in the church, on account of their gravity and solemnity; and this composer, by his fine taste and admirable skill in harmony, brought choral music to a degree of perfection that, (says Dr. Burney,) has never been exceeded. The best church compositions since his time, have, indeed, been proverbially called alla Palestrina, as professedly imitations of his manner. His works were numerous, and most of them are still extant.

His charges, however, like those of empyrics in general, were exorbitant; and having recovered a canon from a dangerous complaint, his demand was so great that the patient refuted to pay it, which produced a hearing before the council, who ordered the canon to pay only the accustomed fee. This so irritated Paracelsus that he left Basil and went into Alsace, where he became noted as an alchemist, and pretended to have found not only the philosopher's stone, but the art of prolonging life by an elixir. Notwithstanding his boast he died poor, in 1541. The best edition of his works is that of Geneva, 1658, 3 vols. folio.",,,,1541.0,d.,92.0,M,d.

,,Pascal (Blaise),Watkins,"Was born at Clermont, in Auvergne, in 1623. His father, who was president of the court of aids, superintended his education; but though he was himself a mathematician, he interdicted his son from that study. Young Pascal, however, in secret applied to geometry, and without any assistance demonstrated one of the most difficult propositions in Euclid. His father then permitted him to pursue his inclination, and at the age of 16 the youth published his Treatise on Conic Sections, which Descartes would not believe was his, but the production of his father. At 19 he invented an arithmetical machine, which, though simple, was unequalled. The Torricellian experiment next engaged his attention, and at the age of twenty-three he made considerable improvements upon it. Not long afterwards he solved a problem proposed by Mersennus, and which had perplexed all the mathematicians in Europe. He now took a sudden turn, renounced the sciences and profane learning, and devoted himself to religious studies. Becoming more abstracted from the world, he retired to the congregation of the Port-Royal, where he applied to the reading of the holy scriptures. But he was not altogether indifferent to the passing scenes of society. He exposed the cause of the Jansenists, and exposed their enemies, the Jesuits, to ridicule, by his work, entitled, Provincial Letters, in which the principles and practices of that celebrated order were laid open in a fine strain of ridicule, and with the irresistible force of truth. Boileau and Voltaire have pronounced them the finest productions in the French language. The author died in the flower of his age, at Paris, in 1662.

Seven years afterwards the Scots, by corrupting the governor, made themselves matters of it again; on which the duke of Lancaster brought an accusation against the earl into parliament, and he was sentenced to lose his life and estates. But the king revoked this sentence, on which Percy laid siege to Berwick and took it. When the duke of Lancaster assumed the crown by the title of Henry IV. he made the earl of Northumberland constable of England. In the 4th year of that reign, the earl and his son Henry (commonly called Hotspur), defeated the Scots at Halidown-hill, and took the earl of Douglas prisoner. Having demanded the pay due to him as keeper of the marches, and not receiving a satisfactory answer, the earl took up arms against the king, and placed Hotspur at the head of his troops, but he was slain at the battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. On this Percy made his submission, and was pardoned. Not withstanding this, he collected another army, and was defeated and slain in Yorkshire in 1406.",,,,1406.0,d.,93.0,,d.,,,152,"Percy, Henry E. of Northumberland",Percy N.,25.0,Statesmen and Warriors,Great Britain,127.0,male,1794.0,D,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Percy,_1st_Earl_of_Northumberland",1361.0,1406.0,case2

,,Perron (James Davy du),Watkins,"A celebrated cardinal, was born of protestant parents at Berne in 1556. He was educated under his father, and acquired a great knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, as well as of the mathematics, philolophy, and history. His proficiency was such that Philip Delportes, abbot of Tryon, reported him to Henry III. of France as a prodigy of memory. Having renounced the protestant religion he entered into orders, and became famous as a preacher, but more as a disputant. His success in converting protestants was great, and among others whom he brought over to his church were Henry and John Spondanus. In 1593 Perron was made bishop of Evreux. In 1600 he had a conference on matters of religion with du Mornay in the prefence of the king, in which Perron was equally matched. This conference procured him the dignity of cardinal. He was employed on several important negotiations, and was made grand almoner of France and archbishop of Sens. He died in 1618.

,,Peter Alexiowitz I. called the great,Watkins,"The son of Alexis Michnelowicz, czar of Muscovy, was placed on the throne after the death of his elder brother Theodore, or Fasdor, to the prejudice of his other brother Iwan, who was as weak in his intellect as in his constitution. The Strelitz, a militia which greatly refembled the Janissaries in Turkey, being excited by the princess Sophia, revolted in favour of Iwan; and to avert a civil war it was resolved that the two princes should reign in conjunction. Russia was at that time little better than in a state of barbarism. The first act of Peter was to introduce a reform among the troops, in which, notwithstanding the difficulty of the talk, he had great success. In 1696 he took Azoph, which he placed in a flute of defence against the Tartars. He next turned his attention to the finances, and corrected many gross abuses. The year following he undertook a journey into various parts of Europe, for the purpolse of acquiring a knowledge of arts, sciences, and mechanics. After passing through Germany he visited Amsterdam, where he entered himself in the company of shipwrights in the dockyard, and worked with great diligence by the name of master Peter. In 1698 he came to England, and paid attention to manufactures, and to every public institution. Having conceived the idea of forming a junction between the Don and the Wolga, he engaged some English engineers to enter into his service, for the accomplishment of that great undertaking. From England the czar went to Vienna, intending to go to Italy, but the news of an insurrection in Russia obliged him to hasten home, where he compelled the princess Sophia, the cause of the revolt, to go into a monastery; several of the insurgents were executed, and the greatest part of the Strelitz decimated or sent to Siberia. In 1699 Peter inslituted the order of St Andrew, by way of raising a spirit of emulation among his subjects. The next year he declared war against Charles XII. of Sweden, but without success. This, however, did not discourage Peter, who said, ""I knew that the Swedes would beat us at first; but they will in time teach us to beat them."" This was verified in 1709 by the important victory of Pultowa; by which the greatest part of the Swedish troops were made prisoners and their king obliged to seek an asylum in Turkey. Peter availed himself of this advantage by seizing Livonia, Ingria, finland, and part of Swedish Pomerania. In the mean time the Turks, at the instigation of Charles XIII. broke their truce with the czar, whom they completely hemmed in with his army on the banks of the Pruth in 1711. In this perilous situation he was saved by the presence of mind of the czarina Catherine. She sent secretly a person to negociate with the grand vizir, who consented to the terms and a peace was settled. In memory of this event was instituted the female order of St. Catherine, of which the czarina became the head. The restoration of tranquillity enabled the czar to make another tour in Denmark, Germany, Holland, and France. When in the latter country he visited the tomb of cardinal Richelieu, on the sight of which he exclaimed, “Great minister, why was you not born in my time? I would have given you one half of my dominions for teaching me how to govern the other.” He is also said to have proposed the plan of a treaty between the two countries to the duke of Orleans, which was declined. The doctors of the Sorbenne presented to the czar plann for reconciling the. Russian church to that of Rome, which Peter received with grace; but after his return he made the pope the subject of a public farce, which gave great offence to the catholic courts, particularly Vienna. Prince Alexis, his son, having joined a party of malecontents, who were displealed at the changes which had taken place both in ecclesiastical and civil matters, the czar caused him to be tried, and the judges sentenced him to death. This decree was not executed, but the prince soon after died as was said of an apoplexy. Some degree of suspicion, however, fell upon the father, which was not removed by the rigorous execution of several of the friends of Alexis. The Tartars having massacred a Russian garrison on the borders of Persia in 1722, Peter embarked on the Caspian Sea, and took the city of Derbent, with three provinces which were afterwards recaptured by Kouli Khan. After this expedition the czar devoted himfelf to the internal regulation of his empire, and of the many important establishments and improvements of which he was the author, the following were the principal; a reform among the clergy, and the abolition of the patriarchal dignity; the organization of a numerous army; the formation of a formidable navy; fortifications in all the principal towns; and an excellent civil government in the cities; an academy for naval education; colleges at Moscow, Petersburg, and Kios; a college of phylldans, and a dispensury at Moscow; public lectures in anatomy, a branch of science in which the czar himself had made great proficiency under Ruysch at Amfterdam; an
observetory, which was also a repository of natural curiosities; a botanical garden, flocked with plants from all parts of the world; printing-offices; and a royal library But one of the most extraordinary works of this great man was the building the city of Petersburg in a morass, the foundations of which consist of piles. He died of the strangury caused by an imposthume in the neck of his bladder, in 1725, aged 63. He wrote several pieces upon naval affairs, and he was a member of the academy of sciences at Paris, to which he sent a chart of the Caspian Sea. By his last will he constituted the empress Catherine his successor.",,,,1725.0,d.,93.0,,d.

At the end of the eleventh century, a general alarm was spread that the last day was approaching, on which numbers of persons flocked to the Holy Land from all countries, with a view of finshing their days near the holy sepulchre. Peter was of the number; and on his return to Europe made so pathetic a representation of the date of the Christians in Palestine to pope Urban II. that he gave Peter leave to preach up the necessity of a crusade throughout Christendom. The appearance, zeal and discourse of the hermit produced a prodigious effect, and all ranks and ages, of both sexes, pressed eagerly into the service. With a numerous and morley army Peter passed through Hungary, and after losing a great number of his followers entered Palestine. He was at the siege of Jerusalem in 1099, where he displayed great bravery, and when the place was taken was made vicargeneral.

,,Petrarch (Francis),Watkins,"A celebrated Italian poet, was born at Arezzo, in 1304 On account of the dissensions which raged in his native country, his father removed with him to Avignon, and afterwards to Carpentras, where Petrarch began his education, which was completed at Montpellier and Bologna. He was intended for the law, but Virgil had more charms for him than Justinian. On the death of his parents he returned to Avignon, where he became passionately in love with a young lady named Laura de Noves, upon whose heart he could make no impression, neither by his constancy nor his verses. Petrarch retired to Vaucluse, a romantic spot, where he poured out his amorous complaints in several pieces. He afterwards travelled into different countries, but with his return to Vaucluse his passion for Laura returned. Again he celebrated her charms and the delights of his retreat. His name became famous; and he received invitations from the senate of Rome, from the king of Naples, and the university of Paris. He accepted the former, and on Easter day, in 1341, he was crowned with laurel in the capitol with great pomp. He was also declared a Roman citizen. In 1348 he received the news of the death of Laura; he was then at Parma, but immediately set out for Vaucluse, where he passed some time in grief. In 1352 he returned to Italy, and at Padua obtained a canonry. He died near that city, in 1374. The sonnets of Petrarch are tender, but his poem on the Punic war, entitled, Africa, posseses little merit. His Latin poems are inferior to the Italian. He also wrote, 1.

He expelled the Jews from his dominions with circumstances of great injustice and cruelty. In 1190 Philip accompanied Richard I. of England to the Holy Land, where they took Acre; but jealousies arising between the two monarchs, Philip returned to France.

Philip gave his assistance to prince Arthur against his uncle John king of England; but John having declared himself a vassal of the holy see, the pope took his part.

For this purpose he assumed the convenient mask of patriotism; but Solon was not to be deceived, and exposed his ambitious views. Pisistratus to effect his object had recourse to an extraordinary device. Having inflicted several wounds on himfels, he appeared before the people, and pretended that an attempt had been made to assassinate him. The credulous Athenians believed the tale, and assigned him a guard, which he increased, and by that means made himsel master of the citadel. The citizens out of fear acknowleged him their fovereign, but Megacles and Lycurgus united their forces, and expelled Pisistratus from Athens. Shortly after Megacles offered to assist Pisistratus on condition of his marrying his daughter, to which the tyrant consented; and to secure the affections of the Athenians, he caused a woman dressed as Minerva to ride through the city in a car, proclaiming the praises of Pisistratus. The people thinking that the goddess had actually descended from heaven, joyfully received the tyrant, who married the daughter of Megacles, but afterwards used her for ill, that her father gathered a force, and compelled him to quit the city. Some years after he made himself masterr of Marathon, and having taken Athens by surprize, put to death all the friends of Megacles.

,,Plato,Watkins,"An illustrious philosopher, was born at Athens B.C. 429. His ather was Aristo, a defendant of Solon, as his mother was from Codrus. His first master was Dionysius the grammarian; and afterwards he received instructions in gymnastic exercises from Aristo, the Argive, who gave him the name of Plato, on account of the broadness of his shoulders and the robustness ot his person. His former name was Aristocles, which was that of his grandfather. He next applied to the study of music and poetry, and composed some pieces intended for the Olympic exercises; but on hearing Socrates deliver a long discourse he burnt them, and became his disciple. Some of his epigrams, however, are still preserved. He resided with Socrates eight years, during which he committed to writing a great part of his master's discourses, which he digested into philosophical conversations: but he made so many improvements on them, that Socrates hearing him one day repeat his Lysis, exclaimed, ""Ye Gods, how many fine things has this young man made me say which I never imagined ?"" On the death of his master, Plato left Athens and travelled into different countries in search of knowlege. At Cyrene he studied geometry and other parts of the mathematics; from thence he went into Egypt under the appearance of a merchant, but In reality to converse with the priests, and to gain information of their religious mysteries. Having resided in Egypt a long time, and added considerably to his mental riches, he visited Italy and settled at Tarentum, where he formed an intimacy with Eurytus and Archytas. He afterwards made a voyage to Sicily to observe the wonders of that island, particularly mount Aetna. On his return to Athens, he settled at a place in the neighbourhood called the Academy, whence his philosophy was called the Academic. His fame was now so great that Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, invited him to his court, but the freedom of his discourse gave such offence that Dionysius ordered him to be sold for a slave. His purchaser was one Anniceres, a native of Cyrene, who gave him his liberty, and he returned to Athens. At the request of Dionysius the younger he once more made a voyage to Sicily, where he was received with great honour, but finding that his advice was not attended to by the tyrant, who chose to copy after his father, he returned to Athens, where he gained a number of followers. He preserved his health by temperance and exercise to the age of 81, and died B.C 348. The philofophy of Plato is so sublime, his morality so pure, and his views of the divine being and a future state so clear, that he has been thought to have had a knowlege of the Mosaic writings; a supposition which, considering his long residence in Egypt, is not improbable. The beft editions of his works are, that of Stephens, 3 vols. folio, 1878; that of Ficinus at Frankfort, fol. 1602; and that of Deux Fonts, 1788, 10 vols. 8vo.

Henry, having assumed the supremacy over the church and caused Dr. Sampson to write a defense of that title, sent the book to Pole, who returned an answer to it under the title 'Pro Unitate Ecclesiae.' This gave such offense that his preferments and pensions were taken from him, but he was abundantly compensated by the pope and emperor. The former made him cardinal in 1536 and appointed him nuncio to France and Flanders. At home, however, he was declared a traitor, and a price was set upon his head. He was one of the legates at the council of Trent, where he attended as long as his health permitted. On the death of Paul III, he was twice elected to succeed him but refused the dignity. Queen Mary was no sooner settled on the throne than Pole was appointed legate to reduce England to the papal see, but before he set out, the act of attainder which had been passed against him was repealed. He arrived in 1554 and was magnificently received and lodged in the palace at Lambeth. Shortly after, he met the parliament and pronounced the papal absolution of the kingdom. The day after the death of Cranmer, he took upon him the title of archbishop of Canterbury, having been promoted to that dignity some time before. He was also elected chancellor of both universities, which he visited by commission. He behaved with moderation to the Protestants and was displeased with the conduct of Gardiner and the other persecuting prelates. He survived Queen Mary only sixteen hours, dying at Lambeth of an ague on November 18, 1553. Besides his book against Henry VIII and his defense of it, he wrote several pieces in favor of the papal authority and the doctrines of the Church of Rome.",,,,1558.0,d.,96.0,D,d.

,,Polignac (Melchior de),Watkins,"A celebrated cardinal, was born at Puy-en-Velay in 1661, of a very ancient family in Languedoc. He received his education at Paris, where he defended the philosophy of Aristotle and that of Descartes at the same time with great ingenuity. The cardinal de Bouillon took him to Rome, where he was employed in several important concerns. In the disputes between the pope and the court of France, Polignac rendered great service by bringing about a reconciliation. Louis XIV sent him ambassador to Poland to procure the election of the prince of Conti after the death of John Sobieski. In this, he failed, and on his return to France, he was for some time in disgrace. He afterward recovered the royal favor, and in 1709 was employed as one of the plenipotentiaries in the conferences at Gertruydenberg for negotiating a peace, and in 1712, he assisted in the same capacity at the treaty of Utrecht. A little before this, Pope Clement XI had conferred on him the dignity of cardinal. After the death of Louis XIV, he was exiled to his abbey of Anchin and was not recalled until 1721. In 1726, he was made archbishop of Auch, and in 1732, commander of the order of the Holy Ghost. He died in Paris in 1741.

,,Pompey,Watkins,"The Great, born B. C. 106, was the son of Pompey, an able general, under whom he learnt the art of war, and with such success that at the age of twenty-three he sailed three legions with which he joined Sylla. Three years afterwards he recovered Sicily and Africa; and became so great a favourite with the army that Sylla recalled him. He obeyed the mandate, though his soldiers wished him to refuse the orders of the dictator. Sylla received him with expressions of friendship, and saluted him with the appellation of the Great. He also obtained the honours of a triumph. Alter the death of Sylla, Pompey compelled Lepidus to quit Rome, and he finished the war in Spain against Sertorius; for which he obtained a second triumph, B. C. 73; and at the same time was elected consul. In his consulate he restored the tribunes, exterminated the pirates, gained great advantages over Tigranes and Mithridates, and made numerous conquests in the East. After these exploits he entered Rome as a private citizen, and was honoured with a third triumph. But his glory procured him many enemies, to counteract whom he joined with Crassius and Caesar in forming the first triumvirate, B. C. 60. To strengthen this alliance he married Julia, daughter of Caesar; but these two great men became rivals in consequence of Pompey's being created sole consul, B. C. 52. On the death of Julia he married Cornelia, daughter of Metellus Scipio, whom he associated with him in the consulate. Ceasar held the government of Gaul, when the senate, at the solicitation of Pompey, passed a decree, commanding him to quit the army, on pain of being declared an enemy to his country. War now broke out between the two parties, who encountered each other on the plains of Pharsalia, where Pompey was defeated, and fled, but was assassinated by two of his officers, on board of the vessel in which he made his escape, B.

,,Pope (Alexander),Watkins,"A celebrated poet, was born in 1688, of a good family, in London, where his father was a considerable merchant. His parents being of the Romish persuasion he was placed at eight years of age under one Taverner, a priest, who taught him the rudiment of the Latin and Greek languages together. About this time meeting with Ogilby's Homer, he was so much pleased that it became his favourite book: and when he was at school at the age of ten he turned some of the events of Homer into a play, which was performed by the upper boys and the master's gardener, who represented Ajax. At the age of twelve he retired with his parents to Binfield in Windsor Forest, where his father had purchased an estate. Here he wrote his Ode on Solitude, which appears as the first fruits of his poetic genius. It was here also that he first met with the works of Waller, Spenser, and Dryden; but on perusing Dryden he abandoned the rest and studied him as a model. In 1704 he wrote his pastorals, which being communicated to Mr. Wycherly, he sent a copy to Mr. Walsh, who was highly delighted with them, and became a valuable friend to the juvenile poet. This year also he produced the first part of his Windsor Forest, which was not published till 1710, with a dedication to lord Lansdown. At the age of twenty appeared his Essay on Criticism, which, notwithstanding the youth of the author, is one of the finest poems in the language, and contains the founded rules. But his genius shone to a greater advantage in his Rape of the Lock, founded on the circumstance of lord Petre's cutting off a lock of Mrs. Fermor's hair. This poem was written to effect a reconciliation between the parties, and was successful. It was printed in 1712, and was followed by the Temple of Fame. The following year he published his proposals for a translation of the Iliad, in which he met with uncommon encouragement, and it enabled him to purchase a house at Twickenham, whither he removed with his parents in 1745. After completing the Iliad, he undertook the Odyssey, for which also he experienced a liberal subscription. He was, however, materially assisted in these works by the learning and abilities of others, particularly Broome, Fenton, and Parnell. The notes from Eustathius were chiefly extracted by Mr. Jortin. In 1721 our author published an edition of Shakspeare, which shews that therein he conlulted his fortune more than his fame. The reputation he had acquired by the success, as well as the merit of his works, procured him numerous enemies among writers of the minor classes, from whom he experienced frequent splenetic attacks. Perhaps it would have been more to his honour had he taken no notice, of them; but in 1727 he vented his resentment in a mock heroic, entitled, The Dunciad, in which he took more than warrantable revenge, and, what was worse, exposed to ridicule many ingenious and respectable persons who had given him no offence. In 1729, by the advice of lord Bolingbroke, he turned his pen to a moral and philosophical subject, the result of which was his Essay on Man, an ethical poem addressed to that statesman. Of this work it is needless to speak, for whatever may be the thought of its leading principle, it possesses refined thoughts and substantial beauties. He next wrote satires, in which he attacked several persons of rank. Mr. Pope was engaged in preparing a complete edition of his works, when he was carried off by adropsy in the chest,in 1744. He bequeathed the property of his works to Dr. Warburton, who published a collection of them with notes, in 1751, in 9 vols. 8vo. Dr. Joseph Warton also published an edition, to which he prefixed, what he had before printed, an admirable Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope. The person of Mr. Pope was little, and crooked; yet there was much life and elegance in his countenance, except when he was labouring under his hereditary complaint, the head-ache. His friendships appear to have been capricious; and he had no small portion of vanity in his disposition, to which and self-interest almost all consderations were readily sacrificed. Of his religious opinions it is difficult to speak. From his Essay on Man it should seem as if he was a mere theist; and though he continued to profess the religion in which he was bred, he occafionally attended his parish church.",,,,1744.0,d.,96.0,P,d.

He still pursued his classical studies as occasion permitted, which proved the means of his advancement, for happening to explain a disputed passage in Horace, to some company at his uncle's house, the earl of Dorset, one of the party, became his patron, and sent him to St. John's College, Cambridge, of which he was chosen fellow. In 1687 he wrote, in conjunction with Mr. Charles Montague, the Hind and Panther transversed to the story of the Country Mouse and City Mouse, by way of burlesquing a piece of Dryden's. In 1690 he was appointed English secretary in the congress at the Hague, and gave so much satisfaction that King William made him gentleman of his bedchamber. In 1696 he was secretary at the treaty of Ryswick, and the following year went to Ireland, as principal secretary of state. Soon after this, he was appointed secretary to the embassy in France; and he had not been long there when going to see the curiosities at Versailles, the officer in attendance showed him the fine paintings by Le Brun of the victories of Louis XIV., asking at the same time whether King William's actions were also to be seen in his palace: ""No, sir,"" answered Prior, ""the monuments of my master's actions are to be seen everywhere but in his own house."" In 1700 he took his place as one of the commissioners of the board of trade and was also elected into Parliament for East Grinstead. He joined with Swift and others in writing a political paper, called the Examiner, in 1710, and next year was appointed minister plenipotentiary to the court of France, where he continued during the remainder of Queen Anne's reign. In 1715 he was arrested by order of the House of Commons and committed to prison. He was even excepted out of the act of grace; but in 1717 he recovered his liberty without being brought to trial.

He then studied medicine at Montpellier, where he took his doctor's degree and became professor in 1531. The chancellor Duprat having abolished the privileges of that university, Rabelais was deputed to wait on him, and he succeeded in obtaining a reversal of that decree. The cardinal du Bellay appointed him his physician and took him in his suite to Rome. On his return to France, he was rewarded with an abbey and the benefice of Meudon.

,,Racine (John),Watkins,"A French poet, was born at Ferre-Milon, in 1639, of a noble family. He was educated in the society of Port Royal, where he devoted his principal attention to the Greek tragic poets. His first publication was an Ode on the Marriage of the King, which procured him a pension. In 1661 he produced his tragedy of Thebaide, which was followed in 1666 by Alexander. Till this time he wore the ecclesiastical habit, which he now renounced. Nicole, in a letter written against Desmarets, having charged the dramatic poet as poisoners of the soul, Racine replied in a severe manner. In 1688 appeared his Andromache, which was attacked by several critics, particularly St. Evremond. His next piece was the tragedy of Britannicus, which far surpassed his former productions. In 1677 appeared his tragedy of Phaedra, which was opposed by one on the same subject written by Pradon, and occasioned violent heats between the partisans of the respective poets. The same year Racine was associated with Boileau in writing the History of Louis XIV. which work was never published. About this time he wrote his sacred drama of either, at the desire of madame de Maintenon, and it was acted by the young ladies of her inftitution of St. Cyr. His belt piece of this kind, was his Athalia. He died in 1699, of chagrin, occasioned by the king's displeasure at a memorial on the miseries of the people, which he had written at the request of madame de Maintenon.

,,Raleigh (sir Walter),Watkins,"Was born at Hayes, in the parish of Budley, in Devonshire, of an ancient family, in 1552. After a proper education, he was sent to Oriel College, Oxford, but did not long remain there, for having an enterprising turn, he entered into the troop of gentlemen volunteers, who went to the assistance of the Protestants in France, where he continued about five or six years. In 1576, he was a student in the Middle Temple, but the year following he served under General Norris in the Netherlands. Soon after his return, he engaged with his brother-in-law, Sir Humphry Gilbert, in a voyage to America, from whence they returned in 1579. The next year he was in Ireland, where he distinguished himself against the rebels in Munster. On his return to England, he introduced himself to the notice of Queen Elizabeth by a piece of gallantry. Her Majesty was taking the air in a walk, when stopping at a dirty place, she hesitated whether to proceed or not; on which Raleigh took off his new plush cloak and spread it on the ground. The queen trod gently over the foot-cloth and soon rewarded the sacrifice of a cloak with a handsome suit to the owner. Being still intent upon making discoveries, he sailed again with Gilbert, who was lost in the voyage. This, however, did not discourage Raleigh, who fitted out another squadron, which discovered the country called, in honor of Elizabeth, Virginia. In 1584, he was elected into Parliament for the county of Devon and knighted. He continued indefatigable in his favorite object of improving navigation and was concerned with his relation Sir Richard Grenville in colonizing Virginia, from whence the first tobacco was brought by this fleet to England. About this time, he was made captain of the queen's guard and lord warden of the stannaries. In the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Sir Walter bore a glorious part, for which he received distinguishing marks of favor from the queen, but having obtained a grant of the manor of Sherborne in Dorsetshire, which had belonged to the bishopric of Salisbury, it gave great offense, and he was stigmatized unjustly as an atheist. About the same time, he incurred the queen's displeasure by an intrigue with one of her maids of honor, whom he afterward married. In 1595, he sailed to Guiana and destroyed the capital of Trinidad. The year following, we find him principally engaged in the taking of Cadiz. Honors were lavished in abundance upon him, and he obtained the lordship of St. Germaine, in Cornwall. Sir Walter had an active concern in the fall of Essex and remained in the favor of the queen till her death. But in the succeeding reign, the face of his affairs was changed. He was stripped of his preferments, tried, and condemned for high treason on a charge the most frivolous and without the least evidence. He lay in the Tower twelve years, during which he wrote several pieces on various subjects of national importance, but his greatest performance was the History of the World, which was published in folio in 1611. The year following, he was released, occasioned by the flattering account which he had given of some rich mines in Guiana. On gaining his liberty, he sailed to that country in search of those pretended mines, instead of discovering which he burnt the Spanish town and returned to England. In consequence of the complaint of Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, he was apprehended and, in a most unprecedented manner, beheaded on his former sentence in Palace Yard, Westminster, in 1618. His works are historical, philosophical, poetical, and political. His son, Carew Raleigh, who was born in the Tower, became governor of Jersey in 1659 and died in 1666. He wrote some sonnets and a vindication of his father against James Howell.",,,,1617.0,d.,98.0,,d.

But in 1551 he was nominated to the regius professorship, but was again persecuted for not pronouncing Q in Latin as K. He was also obnoxious to the Sorbonne for being a protestant, and in the massacre of St. Bartholomew, at Paris, in 1572, this learned and worthy man fell victim. His works are, 1.

,,Ray (John) or Wray,Watkins,"An English divine and botanist, was born at Black-Notley, in Essex, in 1628. His father was a blacksmith, but gave his son a good education at Braintree, from whence he removed to Trinity college, Cambridge, where he became fellow, and Greek and mathematical lecturer. While at the university he cultivated the study of botany, which was then in a low state; but by his example and exertions it became a favourite pursuit. In 1660 he published his ""Catalogus Plantarum Circa Cantabrigiam Nascentium,"" 12mo.; which laid the foundation of his Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicarum, of which excellent work there are two editions in octavo. The same year he was ordained by bishop Sanderson, but in 1662 he quitted his fellowship. After this he made numerous journeys over the kingdom with his friend Mr. Willoughby, and others, in search of plants and other curiosities. He also accompanied the same gentlemen abroad, of which tour he published an account in 1673. He was chosen a fellow of the royal socicty in 1667, and he contributed numerous papers to the transactions of that learned body, on subjects of natural history. In 1679 he fixed his residence near Black-Notley, where he continued perfecting his collections and works till his death, which happened in 1705.

,,Richard of St. Victor,Aikin,"A celebrated divine and Scripture commentator in the 12th century, was a native of Scotland, who went to pursue his studies at the University of Paris. Here he entered among the canons-regular of St. Augustine, at the abbey of St. Victor, and became a pupil of the famous Hugh, who, like him, derived his surname from the same house. Under this master, he assiduously studied the several branches of science, as far as they were then known, particularly theological and biblical literature, and he acquired great reputation by his proficiency, as well as the friendship of the most eminent men in that seat of learning. According to Cave, his fame as a writer commenced about the year 1150. In 1164, he was elected prior of his monastery; where he died in the year 1173, equally respected for his virtues as for his learned attainments. Concerning his merits as a writer, Dupin observes that ""he shows a great deal of subtlety in his theological treatises and argues methodically, with an exactness becoming an able logician. His critical pieces are very accurate, for the time in which he lived. His style, however, is not very elevated; on which account his pious treatises, though abounding in excellent matter, are greatly deficient in weight and energy."" His works consist of critical observations and remarks on some of the historical parts of the Old Testament, relating to the tabernacle and the temple of Solomon; allegorical and moral Commentaries on several of the Psalms, the Song of Songs, and the Apocalypse; questions on certain difficult passages of St. Paul's epistles, and other parts of the Bible, part of which is printed among the works of Hugh of St. Victor; and numerous critical, doctrinal, and practical treatises, which are particularized in the two first of our authorities.

,,Richelieu (Armand Du Pleffis de),Watkins,"A celebrated cardinal and statesman, was born of a distinguished family at Paris in 1585. After completing his studies at the Sorbonne, he went to Rome, and in 1607 was made bishop of Luçon. On his return to France, he advanced himself into favor by an insinuating address, and for his eloquence was appointed almoner to Mary de Medici, by whose favor, in 1616, he obtained the appointment of secretary of state; but the death of his friend the marshal D'Ancre occasioned his temporary disgrace, on which he went to Avignon, but Louis XIII. recalled him to the ministry, and he soon took the lead in the management of public affairs. Having a great hatred for the Protestants, he pressed the siege of Rochelle in person, and by his vigorous efforts compelled it to surrender in 1628. After reducing this important place, he marched against the Huguenots in other provinces, and by his promptitude and skill restored tranquility to the kingdom. He next commanded the army in Italy against the Austrians, where he was unsuccessful. He was again in disgrace for some time, but at length recovered the royal favor, which he enjoyed during the remainder of his life. Gregory XV. made him a cardinal, and he was also created a duke and peer of France. Notwithstanding his ambition and cruelty, he had great qualities. He founded the French Academy; established the royal botanical garden, and was a liberal patron of men of letters. He died in 1642. His works are: 1. The Political Testament, 2 vols. 8vo.; 2. Method of Controversies concerning Points of Faith; 3. Defence of the Catholic Faith; 4. Christian Introduction; 5. Perfection of a Christian; 6. A Journal, which is very curious; 7.

,,Ricimer,Aikin,"Count and Patrician of the Western Empire, and an important civil and military character in the 5th century, was the son of Wallia, daughter of the King of the Visigoths, by a father of Suevian origin. From his youth, he served in the Roman armies, where he acquired great reputation through his warlike exploits, and came to be regarded as the ablest commander of the age. Sidonius Apollinaris accumulates in his character of Ricimer all the excellencies of the most celebrated names in ancient Rome; however, it appears from his actions that they had the alloy of perfidy and unprincipled ambition. In the reign of the Emperor Avitus, being one of the chief commanders of the Barbarian troops that formed the defense of Italy, he destroyed, in the year 456, on the coast of Corsica, a fleet of Genseric the Vandal King, destined to ravage the coasts of Gaul or Italy. This success enabled him to avail himself of the public discontents to depose Avitus and raise Majorian to the throne in 457. The vigor and ability with which this prince maintained his dignity disappointed Ricimer's expectations of enjoying the supreme authority under his name. Ricimer fomented a sedition among the troops at Tortona, where Majorian was encamped on his return from Gaul, and compelled him, in 461, to abdicate the purple, an act soon followed by his death. Ricimer then elevated to the throne one Libius Severus, an obscure man who bore the title of Emperor for four years without performing any imperial function. In that period, and in an interregnum of two years more, Ricimer exercised sovereign authority, amassing treasures, forming a separate army, and negotiating alliances. He cut off a king of the Alans, with all his followers, who had invaded Italy, but he was unable to extend his sway beyond the Alps, where two generals, Egidius in Gaul, and Marcellinus in Dalmatia, maintained themselves in independence. The Barbarian birth of Ricimer prevented his assumption of the purple, and in 467, he concurred in the inauguration of Anthemius, whose daughter he married at the same time. The new Emperor and his potent son-in-law passed some years in union, but eventually, dissensions broke out between them, and Ricimer, withdrawing from Rome, fixed his residence at Milan. There, after a feigned reconciliation with Anthemius, he incited his army to revolt, and with a reinforcement of new Barbarian levies, marched to Rome. After a vigorous resistance, the unfortunate capital was stormed and sacked with every circumstance of cruelty in July 472, and Anthemius, dragged from his concealment, was murdered by order of Ricimer, who caused Olybrius to be proclaimed in his stead. He himself was shortly after carried off by disease, bequeathing the command of his army to his nephew Gundebald, a Burgundian prince.",,,,472.0,d.,99.0,,d.,,,144,Ricimer,Ricimer,17.0,Statesmen and Warriors,Germany,127.0,male,1990.0,D,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricimer,427.0,472.0,case2

,,Rotharis,Aikin,"King and legislator of the Lombards, was Duke of Brescia at the time of the death of King Ariovald in 638, who left a widow named Gundeberg, and no male issue. The Lombard nobles gave Gundeberg the privilege of raising to the throne the person she should choose for a husband, and her choice fell upon Rotharis. He repudiated his wife for the sake of his royal spouse, whom he promised to maintain in the dignity of queen. He was, however, an Arian and she a Catholic; and either in consequence of that diirerence, or some other cause of dissention, he violated his obligation, and shut her up in an apartment of the palace of Pavia, till, after a confinement of five years, she was restored to her rank through the mediation of Clovis II. Rotharis, soon after his election, had to contend against the opposition of some disaffected nobles, which he quelled with great severity, and afterwards reigned with equal glory and prosperity at home and abroad. Not conceiving himself bound by the treaty his predecessor had made with the exarch of the empire, he suddenly broke into the province of the Cottian Alps, which he reduced, and then made himself master of all the towns in the Venetian province. The exarch in the meantime made an incursion into the Lombard territory, which called away Rotharis from his conquests; and an engagement ensued, in which the exarch was totally defeated, and obliged to save the relics of his army by flight. Rotharis likewise penetrated into Liguria, and took Genoa, Albenga, and other maritime towns, which he pillaged and dismantled, carrying away the inhabitants as prisoners. It was much more to his praise that he was the first who gave to his nation a code of written laws. In the fifth year of his reign he summoned a general diet of his nobles at Pavia, where, with their consent, he enacted a number of laws, which were made public in an edict issued in 643, consisting of 386 articles. Although many of these have the stamp of a rude age and people, yet they are accounted more judicious than the laws of some other barbaric people; and it is observable that Rotharis was sufficiently enlightened to deride the superstition of witchcraft, and protect the victims of that imputed crime from popular rage. He also practised religious toleration, and provided in all the cities of his kingdom a bishop for each of the two persuasions, the Arian and the Catholic. After having filled the Lombard throne for 15 years and 4 months, with the character of the most illustrious prince of his time, he died in 653, at the age of 47.",,,,652.0,d.,100.0,,d.,,,144,Rotharis the Lombard,Rotharis,17.0,Statesmen and Warriors,Italy,127.0,male,2011.0,D,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothari,607.0,652.0,case2

,,Rupert,Aikin,"a learned and pious Benedictine abbot in the twelfth century, was a native of Flanders, and born in the territory of Ypres, in the year 1091. He embraced the monastic life at a very early age, in the abbey of St. Lawrence, near Liege, where his application to his studies was incessant, till he had made an extraordinary progress in all the literature of the times, and had acquired a knowledge of the Scriptures superior to that of most of his contemporaries. By his unrivalled merit in that community he secured the distinguished favour of the Abbot Berenger; but at the same time provoked the envy and ill offices of the indolent and ignorant monks. On this account Berenger, when he was sensible that he was near his end, recommended Rupert to the protection of Cuno, Abbot of Siegberg in Westphalia. Under his patronage, delivered, as we are informed by himself, from the persecutions of false brethren, our learned monk began to communicate to the world his commentaries on the sacred Scriptures, in the year 1117. By these and other productions of his pen, his reputation was raised so high, that Frederic Archbishop of Cologne, took him from the cloister, and made him abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Duyts, on the banks of the Rhine opposite to that city. Here he died in the year 1135, about the age of forty-four. He was one of the principal persons who contributed to introduce a new mode of commenting upon the Scriptures in this century. For, instead of following the example of the ancient fathers, who were accustomed to explain the text either literally or allegorically, or imitating the ecclesiastical authors between the eighth century and his own time, whose works of this kind consisted only of Catena's, or continued collections of explications and glosses from the writings of different fathers; he endeavoured to illustrate the Scriptures chiefly by'the use of dialectics, discussing a variety of subtle questions relating to doctrinal points, and producing a great number of common places. It is also deserving of notice, that his opinion relating to the eucharist differed widely from the Catholic doctrine of more modern times, since he held, that though the real body and blood of Christ were present in that sacrament, yet the real substance of the bread and wine also remained in it. His works consist of "" Commentariorum de sanctissima Trinitate et operibus ejus, Lib. XLII."" including his illustration of the Pentateuch, the books of Joshua, Judges, parts of the books of Kings and the Psalms, the prophesies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Malachy, the books of the Macchabees, some parts of the four gospels, and other selected passages of Scripture; ""Comment, in Cantica Canticorum, Lib.

He afterward entered into various schemes for effecting this object, and some of them being considered treasonable, he was tried, condemned, and beheaded in 1683. After the Revolution, the parliament passed an act to consider who were the advisers of the murder (so they called it) of his lordship.

,,Ruysbroeck,Aikin,"a famous Flemish mystical writer in the 14th century, was bom at the village whence he took his surname, situated between Brussels and Hall, in the year 1293. He was placed for education under the instructions of a canon to whom he was related; but at the age of fifteen, when he had made but a small progress in grammar-learning, he renounced the study of all human wisdom, for that of spiritual knowledge, and for divine contemplation. Having been admitted to priest's orders, he became at first curate and next rector of the church of St. Gedula at Brussels. Afterwards he retired into the forest of Soignies, and at Groendal, two leagues from Brussels, founded a monastery for canons-regular of the order of St. Augustine, in which he filled the post of prior. The last office which he held was that of reformer of the order throughout the Low-Countries. Before he quitted Brussels he had published seme pieces in mystical divinity, which were much esteemed by persons of the same spiritual taste; but those of his writings which they considered to abound in the most sublime thoughts, which, as they tell us, "" ravished to admiration, and even almost to extacy, the most excellent professors in divinity, who owned that they could not comprehend them,"" appear to have been produced at Groendal. Of his fanatical turn of mind we may form some idea, from the answer which he gave to Gerard Magnus, who excepted against some singular notions and expressions in his books. "" Be perfectly assured,"" said he, "" that I never inserted a single word in my writings without being inspired by the Holy Ghost; and in a certain singular and most delightful presence of the most Holy Trinity."" It is said, that when he was about to compose any work, he was accustomed to retire alone into the most unfrequented part of the forest, where he waited in the deepest silence expecting inspiration from above; and that whenever he imagined communications were made to him, he wrote them down, to serve as materials for the works which he drew up and digested after his return to his monastery. He died in the year 1381, at the great age of eighty-eight. His works were orignally written in the Flemish language, and were some of them translated into Latin by William Jordan, a contemporary and of the same order with the author. Afterwards the whole of them were translated into that language, by Laurence Surius. They consist of "" Regnum Amantium Deum, sive Summa Vitas Spirituals;"" "" De Nuptiis spiritunlibus, Lib. III.;"" "" De Calculo, sive de Perfectione Filiorum Dei;"" "" De Quatuor Tentationibus;"" "" De Fide et Judicio;"" "" De VII.

He then returned to France, where he applied himself to the study of mathematics and, in a fit of illness, wrote his Reveries, or Military Memoirs; a work of equal service to the general and common soldier. On the death of his father in 1733, war was rekindled, and the Elector of Saxony, his brother, offered him the command of his forces, which he declined, giving the preference to the French service. He then joined Marshal Berwick on the Rhine and displayed great skill and bravery at the siege of Philippsburg, for which he was made lieutenant-general. In 1741, the count took Prague, which was followed by the capture of Agria. In 1744, he was made Marshal of France and Commander-in-Chief in Flanders. The next year, he gained the battle of Fontenoy, although he was so ill that he had to be carried on a litter. This victory was followed by the fall of several strong towns, particularly Brussels. In 1746, he gained the battle of Rocoux, and the same year was appointed Marshal of all the French armies and Governor of all the places conquered in the Low Countries.

,,Severus (Lucius Septimus),Watkins,"A Roman emperor, was born in Africa, of a noble family. He passed through various offices of the state, and was distinguished for his ambition, activity, and avarice. After the murder of Pertinax he caused himself to be proclaimed emperor on the borders of Illyricum, and took as his associate Albinus, who commanded the army in Britain. His reception at Rome was gratifying to his vanity, but he was opposed by Pescennius Niger, who had a numerous army in the East. Many battles were fought between them, but at length Niger was destroyed and his head sent to Severus, who behaved cruelly to all the partisans of his unfortunate rival. Elated with this succefs he pillaged Byzantium, and attempted to put away Albinus by assasination, but being foiled he had recourse to arms. Albinus was defeated and slain in Gaul, and his family and adherents shared his fate. Severus, on his return to Rome, put to death the wealthiest citizens that he might possess himfelf of their property. Tired of an inactive life he marched into the East, where he made numerous conquests. The revolt of Britain recalled him from Asia; and having reduced the island he built a wall across the northern part to defend the Roman possesions from the invasions of the Caledonians. While in Britain an attempt was made upon his life by his son Caracalla, but it failed; and Severus calling him into his presence presented to him his sword, saying, ""If you are ambitious of reigning murder me in secret, but let not the world be wittnesses of your guilt."" This remonstrance checked Caracalla, who withdrew in silence. Severus, worn out with a complication of disorders, died at York AD. 211. There were two others of this name who affumed the imperial title, both of whom were put to death; the first by Maximian in 307, and the last in 461.",,,,211.0,d.,103.0,,d.

,,Shakespeare (William),Watkins,"Father of the English drama, was born of a good family at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. His father, who was a considerable dealer in wool, had so large a family that he could give him but a scanty education. He was indeed for some time at the grammar school at Stratford, where he learnt the rudiments of the Latin language but was prevented from making any further progress by being taken home to follow his father's business. While he was yet very young he married the daughter of one Hathaway, a substantial farmer in the neighbourhood. In this kind of settlement he continued till, by an act of folly and dissipation, he was obliged to leave the country and his family. He had, by a misfortune common to young fellows, fallen into bad company, and amongst them some who were in the practice of deer-stealing. By them he was prevailed upon, more than once, to engage in robbing the park of Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlecote, near Stratford. For this, he was prosecuted by that gentleman, and out of revenge he made a ballad upon Sir Thomas, which is said to have been so bitter that the prosecution was redoubled, and he was obliged to shelter himself in London. Here he formed an acquaintance with the players and was enrolled among them, as his name is in the list of performers prefixed to several old plays, though what sort of characters he performed does not appear. Mr. Rowe observes that he never could meet with any further account of him as an actor than that his highest part was the Ghost in his own Hamlet. We are equally ignorant which was the first play he wrote, though the dates of many of his pieces are easily fixed by particular passages. Queen Elizabeth had several of his plays acted before her, and without doubt gave him many marks of her favor. She was so pleased with the character of Falstaff in the two parts of Henry IV. that she commanded him to exhibit him in love, on which occasion Shakespeare wrote his rich and admirable comedy of the ""Merry Wives of Windsor."" The Earl of Southampton was his particular friend, and hearing that he had an inclination to make a purchase but wanted the means, he generously sent him one thousand pounds. Shakespeare was also very intimate with Ben Jonson, who gives him a high character in his Discoveries. After conducting the theatre many years with great reputation, he retired to his native place, where his wit and good nature introduced him to the acquaintance of the gentlemen in the neighborhood. Amongst others was one Mr. Combe, an old gentleman noted for his wealth and usury. In a conversation one day, Mr. Combe told Shakespeare that he supposed if he outlived him, he would write his epitaph, and since he could not tell what might be said of him, he desired it might be done immediately, on which our poet produced these lines: ""Ten in the hundred lies here ingrav'd, Tis a hundred to ten his foul is not fav'd; If any man ask, who lies in this tomb? Oh! Oh! quoth the devil, 'tis my John-a-Combe"" But the sharpness of the satire so stung the man that he never forgave it. Shakespeare died in 1616,  and was buried in the church of Stratford, where a monument is placed to his memory. On the gravestone underneath is the following inscription: ""Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, to dig the dust inclosed here. Blest be the man that spares these stones, and curse be he that moves my bones."" He had three daughters: two lived to be married, Judith to Mr. Thomas Quincy, and Susanna to Dr. Hall, a physician.

,,Cooper (Anthony Ashley),Watkins,"Earl of Shaftesbury, was born at Winborne in Dorsetshire, 1621, and educated at Exeter collage, Oxford. In 1640 he was elected into parliament for Tewkesbury. At the beginning of the troubles he inclined to the side of royalty, but quitted it for the other party, and accepted a commission in its service. When Cromwell assumed the government, he opposed him with warmth, and contributed much to the restoration of the king. Soon after that event he was sworn of the privy-council, and created lord Ashley; appointed chancellor of the exchequer, and one of the commissioners of the treasury. In 1672 he was created earl of Shaftesbury, and the same year was made lord chancellor, which office he resigned the year following. He opposed the Test Bill, brought into the house of lords by the earl of Danby, on which account the parliament was prorogued. The earl contended in the next session that the parliament ought to be considered as dissolved, for which he was sent to the Tower, where he continued thirteen months. On the change of ministry, in 1679, he was made president of the council, but resigned the place shortly after. In 1681 he was tried for high treason, and acquitted. On this he went to Holland, where he died in 1683. His private life did not answer his great talents, and Charles II. once said to him, ""I believe, Shaftesbury, thou art the wickedest fellow in my dominions"" to which his lordship gravely replied, ""May it please your majesty, of a subject, I believe I am;"" at which the king laughed heartily.",,,,1713.0,d.,103.0,Mor,d.

In the controversy excited by Bishop Hoadley on the constitution of the church, Dr. Sherlock bore a conspicuous part and attacked the bishop in an able pamphlet in vindication of the Corporation and Test Acts. He also answered Collins in six excellent discourses on the use and intent of prophecy and wrote with equal strength a defense of the miracle of Christ's resurrection against Woolston, in a work entitled, the Trial of the Witnesses. He was successively Dean of Chichester, Bishop of Bangor, Salisbury, and London. On the death of Archbishop Potter, he was offered the See of Canterbury, which he declined. He died in 1761.

For his gallant conduct against the French on the coast of Ireland, he was knighted by king William, and made an admiral. He had a considerable share in the victory of La Hogue, and in that off Malaga in 1704. The year following he had the command of the fleet in the Mediterranean, and contributed to the taking of Barcelona. In 1707 he proceeded for England, but in the night of Odtober 22, the admiral's ship, called the Association, and several others, struck upon the rocks of Scilly, and were lost.

,,Sigebertus,Aikin,"One of the most learned and diligent writers of his time, appears to have been a native of Brabant, and in his younger years embraced the monastic state in the abbey of Gemblours, under the Abbot Olbertus, who died in 1048. During his noviciate he was invited to Metz, where he studied in the school of the monastery of St. Vincent, which was then superintended by the Abbot Folcuinus, who had been his school fellow at Gemblours. Calmet places the arrival of Sigebert at Metz about, the year 980, which does not agree with the other dates; and this is the more surprizing, as the catalogue of the abbots of the abbey of St. Vincent in that author places the Abbot Folcuinus about the year 1050. But whoever young Sigebert may have been, he acquired great consideration by his learning, in which he was superior to most of the other writers who flourished at the same period. He was acquainted with the Greek and the Hebrew, and in consequence of the progress he had made in the latter, was much esteemed by the Jews at Metz, where he resided several years, and from which he was with difficulty suffered to depart in order to return to his former monastery. His celebrity accompanied him thither; he gained many scholars who did honour to their instructor, and he was chosen by the clergy of Liege to manage their defence in a controversy they had with the Pope, which he conducted with great ability and moderation. In the account which he gives in his chronicle of this dispute, he has attended to the duty of an historian, and written with a candour and in a manner which evidently shew that he did not suffer his pen to be guided by the blind impulse of passion. He attained to a great age, and died in 1112. Sigebert was a fertile writer, and composed many works, of which he has himself given a catalogue. They are chiefly biographical and historical; and a list of such as have been preserved and are printed either separately or in different collections, may be found in the work which is the authority for this article.",,,,1113.0,d.,103.0,H,d.,,,15,Sigebert,Sigebert,15.0,Historians and Antiquaries Lawyers,France,0.0,male,2114.0,D,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigebert_of_Gembloux,1068.0,1113.0,case2

,,Simpson (Thomas),Watkins,"A mathematician, was born at Market Bosworth in Leicestershire, in 1710.

So great was his progress that in 1737, he published his excellent Treatise on Fluxions, which brought him into considerable notice.

He made so great progress in learning as to be admitted into orders, after which he became a doctor and professor of divinity at Sienna, when he took the name of Montalto. His talents as a preacher procured him the appointment of commissary-general at Bologna and inquisitor at Venice, but his conduct in the latter city gave so much offense to the senate that he was compelled to quit their territory. After obtaining several marks of distinction, he was made cardinal in 1570. In this situation, he affected uncommon humility and devotion and counterfeited the weaknesses of sickness and age with so much art as to dupe the whole conclave. After the death of Gregory XIII, the cardinals were divided about the election, when considering that Montalto was an infirm old man who could not live long, they united in choosing him to the vacant chair. The election was no sooner declared than, to the astonishment of all present, he jumped into the midst of the chapel, threw away his crutch, and began to sing the Te Deum with a loud voice. He commenced his pontificate by clearing the ecclesiastical state of the numerous robbers which infested it. He also punished with great severity all kinds of vice and was inflexible in the administration of justice. He limited the number of cardinals to seventy, raised the famous obelisk which Caligula had caused to be brought from Spain [See Fontana], and reformed many abuses which prevailed in the government.

,,Socrates,Watkins,"A celebrated philosopher of Athens, was the son of a sculptor, and followed the fame profession for some years. Crito observing his genius, and admiring his discourses, called him from this employment to the study of philosophy. He also joined his countrymen in arms, and distinguished himself in several actions, in which he saved the lives of Xenophon and Alcibiades, with whom he contracted a close friendship. On his return to Athens he displayed in his manners a remarkable contrast to his contemporaries, by the plainness of his dress and the frugality of his living. In his philosophical lectures he endeavored to effect a general reformation by recommending virtue. He was followed by a number of illustrious disciples, whom he instructed sometimes in the groves of Academus, and at others in the Lyceum, or on the banks of the Ilyffus. The independence of his mind, and the powerful eloquence of his discourses, excited against him many enemies, particularly Melitus and Anitus, at whose instigation Ariftophanes ridiculed him in a comedy called the Clouds. Socrates was next accused before the council of five hundred of corrupting the Athenian youth, of introducing innovations in religion, and of ridiculing the gods. These absurd charges were supported by the perjury of witnesses, and the judges being mostly envious of his reputation condemned him to death. The solemn celebration of the Delian festival hindered the execution for a month, which time he employed in discoursing with his friends on the immortality of the soul and other sublime subjects. He was urged to make his escape, which he easily might have done, as the gaoler's permission had been obtained, but he nobly refused, saying, ""Where am I to go to avoid death ?"" When the term of the festival was ended, he drank of the poison with perfect composure, after making a libation to the gods, and in a few moments he expired. Thus perished, 400 years B. C. and in the 70th year of his age, Socrates, whom the oracle had pronounced the wisest man in Greece. The Athenians repented of their ingratitude, and his enemies were universally hated and died miserably.

,,Speusippus,Aikin,"An Athenian philosopher, son of Eurymedon by a sister of Plato, succeeded his uncle in his school, over which he presided during eight years, commencing from the death of that celebrated teacher, B.C. 348. He placed the statues of the Graces in the school built by Plato in the academy, and closely adhered to the doctrines of his master. His manners, however, were not conformable to his philosophy, for he was passionate and a lover of pleasure, of which last propensity he gave proof by paying a visit to the court of Cassander in Macedonia at the splendid nuptials of that prince. He was also avaricious; and, contrary to the practice of Plato, exacted a gratuity from his disciples. Through the introduction of Plato, he was admitted to an intimate friendship with Dion while he resided at Athens, and it was by his instigation that Dion, invited by the malcontents of Syracuse, undertook his expedition against Dionysius. Becoming paralytic in his limbs, he was conveyed to and from the academy on a vehicle. On one of these occasions, he met Diogenes and saluted him; but the cynic, instead of returning his civility, upbraided him for bearing to live under such an infirmity. Speusippus well replied, ""that he lived not in his limbs, but in his mind."" At length, however, according to Laertius, being overcome by age and malady, he put an end to his existence, having first constituted Xenocrates his successor in the academy. He was the author of several philosophical treatises, which have perished, though Aristotle thought them worth purchasing at the price of three talents",,,,-339.0,d.,105.0,HP Ac,d.,,,112,Speusippus,Speusippus,13.0,Divines and Metaphysicians &cc,Turky in Europe,99.0,male,2168.0,D,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speusippus,-384.0,-339.0,case2

,,Swift (Jonathan),Watkins,"A celebrated divine, was born at Dublin, of English parents, in 1667. His father died a few months before the birth of this child, leaving his widow in narrow circumstances. At the age of six years, Jonathan was sent to Kilkenny School, from whence, in 1682, he was removed to the University of Dublin, the expense of his education being defrayed by his uncle. While at college, he paid more attention to books of history and poetry than logic and those classes, so that he was denied his degree on his first application and obtained it with difficulty on the second. On the death of his uncle in 1688, he came to England, where he was hospitably entertained by Sir William Temple, who had married a relation of his mother's. During his residence with Sir William, who employed him in revising his works, he formed the resolution of embracing the ecclesiastical life; and having taken his master's degree, he was ordained and obtained the prebend of Kilroot, in the diocese of Connor, worth about one hundred pounds a year. Being disappointed of preferment in England, he accompanied the Earl of Berkeley, one of the Lords Justices of Ireland, as his chaplain and private secretary; but he was again disappointed and dismissed with the livings of Laracor and Rathbeggin, and the rectory of Augher, instead of the deanery of Derry, which had been promised him. He then settled at Laracor, where he rebuilt the parsonage house, repaired the church, and discharged his parochial duties in an exemplary manner. About this time, he was visited by Mrs. Johnson, the celebrated Stella, whom he afterward secretly married but would never own it, in consequence of which she broke her heart. This amiable woman was the daughter of Sir William Temple's steward and had an independent property left her by that gentleman. At the accession of Queen Anne, Swift embarked in politics in hopes of preferment in England, which he again missed, and in 1713 was promoted to the deanry of St. Patrick's, Dublin. The death of Queen Anne closed all his prospects and completely embittered his temper. He was for some time very unpopular in Dublin but came at last to be revered as an oracle. One Wood projected a coinage of £180,000 of Irish halfpence, for which he obtained a patent. Swift immediately addressed a series of letters to the people under the signature of a Drapier, urging them not to receive this base coin; and so successful was he that the patent was withdrawn. After the death of Stella in 1727, he led a very retired life and wasted his time in literary trifles that were unworthy of public notice. In 1730, he entirely lost his memory, and almost to his death, he was secluded from the visits of strangers, as his passions still continued to be extremely violent. He died in 1745 and was buried in the Cathedral of St. Patrick. His ill-treatment of Stella having been mentioned, it is necessary to notice his conduct to the lady celebrated in his works under the appellation of Vanessa. She was the daughter of Mr. Vanhomrigh, a Dutch merchant at Dublin, and conceived a strong inclination for the dean, which he seems to have encouraged; but when at last she declared her mind, he told her he was married, which had such an effect upon her that she died a few weeks afterward. He left the greatest part of his property for the purpose of building a hospital for lunatics at Dublin. The poetical pieces of Swift are mostly of the humorous kind, and some of them very coarse and licentious. His prose style is remarkably clear and forcible. The principal of his works are a satirical romance called ""Gulliver's Travels""; the allegory of ""A Tale of a Tub,"" in which he ridicules popery and puritanism; and political tracts against the Whigs. All his works have been collected into 22 vols. 8vo.",,,,1745.0,d.,106.0,P,d.

He was nominated one of the king's judges but did not sit in the high court of justice on that occasion. When Cromwell assumed the sovereignty under the title of Protector, Sidney retired to private life. At the Restoration, he went abroad but returned in 1667, on obtaining a pardon, the condition of which was that he should conduct himself as a peaceable subject. In 1683 he was apprehended, on a charge of being concerned in the Rye House Plot, tried before Judge Jeffreys, and sentenced to death, which was executed on Tower Hill the same year. The sentence against him was declared illegal in the first parliament of William and Mary.

In 1576, Queen Elizabeth appointed him ambassador to the Emperor Rodolphus II, and at that court, he contracted an intimacy with the famous Don John of Austria. On account of his declaring his sentiments freely against the queen's marriage with the Duke of Anjou in 1580, he retired from court, and in his retreat wrote his celebrated romance, called Arcadia. In 1582, he received the honor of knighthood, and in 1585, he was appointed governor of Flushing and general of the horse sent to the assistance of the United Provinces. About this time, his reputation for wisdom and valor stood so high that he was thought a fit person to be a candidate for the crown of Poland, but the queen would not consent that England should lose so great a jewel. In September 1586, Sir Philip displayed uncommon bravery at the Battle of Zutphen but received a mortal wound in the thigh as he was mounting his third horse, having had two slain under him before. While he was in the arms of his attendants, who had procured for him a bottle of wine to allay his thirst, a wounded soldier was carried past him and cast a wistful eye on the bottle, on which Sir Philip ordered it to be taken to him, saying, ""Poor fellow, thy necessity is greater than mine!"" This pride of the English nation died of his wound twenty-five days afterwards. His body was brought home and buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. His ""Arcadia"" has been several times printed in 4to and folio.

Being chosen praetor, he was appointed to place Ariobarzanes on the throne of Cappadocia, which he effected. He afterwards terminated the war with the Marsi, for which he was rewarded with the consular dignity. He now aspired to the title of perpetual dictator but met with a powerful opponent in Marius. However, after putting an end to the war with Mithridates and conquering Greece, he entered Rome in triumph and murdered all whom he considered as inimical to his ambitious views. The streets of Rome were filled with dead bodies, and those to whom he had promised pardon were inhumanly massacred. After reigning in terror and altering the laws according to his own humor, Sulla voluntarily resigned the dictatorship and retired to his estate at Puteoli, where he spent the remainder of his days in debauchery with some of the most vicious of the common people.

Though the son was just nine years old, he wrote verses on their misfortune, comparing himself to young Ascanius escaping with Aeneas. Young Tasso was sent to Padua to study the law, and while there, he wrote his poem ""Rinaldo"" at the age of seventeen. In 1565, he was taken into the service of the Duke of
Ferrara, with whose sister, Princess Eleonora, he fell in love. This fatal passion proved the source of that melancholy humor which plagued him for twenty years. Quitting Ferrara he went to his sister at Sorento, and was joyfully received by her; but his flame becoming stronger by absence, he returned to the court of Ferrara, where, in the presence of the duke, he had the imprudence to embrace the princess with transport. Alphonso with great coolness ordered him to be taken to a hospital, as a man deprived of his reason. At the desire of the Duke de Gonzaga, he obtained his freedom in 1586. He then retired to Naples, where he enjoyed some peace for a time. Pope Clement VIII, who greatly admired his talents, summoned him to Rome.

fl.,1110.0,Theodorus Prodromus,Aikin,"or, as he is called, Cyrus Theodorus Predromus, and, in some manuscripts, Ptochoprodromus, a Greek monk, flourished at Constantinople about the beginning of the twelfth century. He was descended from a respectable family, and speaks of his having a bishop as his maternal uncle. It appears by his numerous works, the greater part of which are still in manuscript, that he was a man of considerable learning, and possessed a genius for poetry, which led him to cultivate the muses; but in his poetical attempts he does not seem to have been very successful. It appears also that he had some connection with the orphan-house at Constantinople, in which, in all probability, he was a teacher; but if we may judge from some of his verses he lived in a state of great poverty. He was the author of various works, written between the years 1118 and 1143, of which several are contained in a collection entitled, ""Theodori Prodromi Epigrammata ut vetustissima ita piissima, quibus omnia utriusque Testamenti Capita felicissime comprehenduntur, cum aliis nonullis,"" Basiliae, 1536. 8vo.

,,Theodosius,Watkins,"A Roman emperor, was born in 346 at Cauca, a city in Spain, of a noble family. His father, count Theodosius, was beheaded by order of Valens in 376. The son was called to court by Cratian, who associated him in the empire, and appointed him to govern Thrace and those provinces which Valentinian had possessed in the East. He defeated the Goths in several actions, and compelled them to sue for peace. His fame spread into Persia, and Sapor III. solicited his alliance. In 385 a conspiracy was formed against him, but it was discovered, and Theodofius displayed the magnanimity of his disposition by pardoning the criminals. But in 390 he committed a cruel action in causing the inhabitants of Thessalonica to be put to the sword, on account of a sedition and riot in their city. St. Ambrose was so struck with horror by this transaction that he refused to admit Theodosius into the church till he had given proof of repentance. The emperor, having defeated Maximus, marched to Home, where he received the honors of a triumph, after which he returned to Constantinople and defeated the barbarians who had ravaged Macedonia and Thrace. He then turned his arms against the usurper Eugenius, who had been placed on the throne after the murder of Valentinian. Having defeated him at Aquileia, he caused him to be beheaded in 394.

fl.,-75.0,Theodosius,Aikin,"an ancient mathematician, a native of Tripoli in Africa, flourished, in all probability, about the second or third century. He applied chiefly to those parts of the mathematics which relate to the doctrine of the sphere, and on that subject wrote three books, the first containing twenty-two propositions; the second twenty-three, and the third fourteen, all demonstrated in the pure geometrical manner of the ancients. The author's object in this work was to establish the geometrical principles of astronomy, and to explain the different phenomena of which it treats. With this view he did what Euclid had done in regard to the elements of geometry. He collected into one body the different propositions discovered before his time by astronomers and geometricians, for there is great reason to suppose that the theory was then little known, and understood only in an imperfect manner. These books were much used by Ptolemy, as well as by succeeding writers, and were translated by the Arabians into their own language from the original Greek. From the Arabic, the work was again, translated into Latin, and printed at Venice; but the Arabic version being very defective, a more complete edition was published in Greek and Latin at Paris in 1556, 4to., by John Pena, regius professor of astronomy. The works of Theodosius were commented on and illustrated also by Clavius, Hologanius and Guarinus; and by De Chales in his Cursus Mathematicus. But the edition of Theodosius's Spherics, now chiefly used is that of the learned Dr. Barrow, published in the year 1675, illustrated and demonstrated in a new and concise method. From this author's account, Theodosius appears not only to have been a great master in the more difficult parts of geometry, but the first considerable author of antiquity who wrote upon the same subject. He was the author also of two other treatises; one entitled ""De Habitationibus,"" and the other ""De Diebus et Noctibus,"" which contain geometrical demonstrations of the phenomena that must appear to the inhabitants of different parts of the earth. Greek copies of these were preserved in the King's library at Paris, and a Latin edition of them was published by Peter Dasypodius in 1572.",,,,,,108.0,M,fl.,,,87,Theodosius Tripolitanus,Theodosius,18.0,Mathematicians &cc Physicians,Turky in Asia,69.0,male,2267.0,A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_of_Bithynia,-105.0,-60.0,case3

,,Theseus,Aikin,"A celebrated hero in the semifabulous ages of Greece, is placed by chronologers in the 13th century B.C.. Amidst the fables in which his history is enveloped, the following narrative may approach the nearest to credibility. He was the son of Aegeus King of Athens, who having no legitimate children, appears to have had a secret connection with Aethra, daughter of Pittheus, King of Troezern, when he was paying a visit to that prince. On his departure, he left a sword and other tokens, directing Aethra, that if the child of which she was pregnant should prove a male, he should at a proper age be sent to Athens with these tokens, that he might be recognized. Young Theseus, on growing up, displayed a courageous spirit in a vigorous frame; and when he had acquired strength sufficient to lift a great stone under which the tokens were placed, they were given to him, and the secret of his parentage was revealed to him. His mother and grandfather advised him to proceed to Athens by sea, in order to avoid the dangers by land through a country overrun by robbers; but these hazards only stimulated his enterprizing disposition. In his journey he met with several adventures which have been related by poets and fabulists, in all of which he came off victorious. He arrived at Athens, where he found the court of Aegeus agitated by dissensions. The sons of Pallas, the King's brother, who were numerous and powerful, were impatient under the rule of a childless old man, and in the apprehension that he would adopt this valiant stranger for his heir, they endeavoured to fill his mind with suspicions of him. They were so successful, that Aegeus had prepared poison for him, when he was discovered to his father by means of his tokens, and the consequence was a revolt of the Pallantides, which Theseus suppressed. At this time Athens was under the obligation of paying a tribute at stated periods of seven youths and virgins to Minos, King of Crete, as a penalty for the death of his son Androgeus, who was supposed to have been killed by the Athenians. These young persons are fabulously said to have been destined for victims to a monster called the Minotaur, confined in a labyrinth; but the Cretans affirm that they were given as prizes to the victors in certain games celebrated in honour of Androgeus. Whatever were their fate, the exacted tribute filled the principal families of Athens with mourning; and Theseus was resolved upon an attempt to free the city from such a disgraceful imposition. Causing himself to be enrolled among the victims, he was conveyed to Crete; where, as the story relates, he slew the Minotaur, and escaped from the labyrinth by means of a clue furnished by the King's daughter, Ariadne; but, according to the more probable narration, he vanquished at the games the royal champion, Taurus, and through the admiration excited by his valour obtained a remission of the tribute, with Ariadne for a wife. Returning to Athens, he succeeded to the crown on the death of Aegeus, when, taking example from what he had observed in Crete, then the most civilized and flourishing of the Grecian states, he consolidated the twelve towns of Attica, founded by Cecrops, into one government, of which Athens was the head, and gave the nation a constitution, by which the legislative power was placed in a general assembly of the people divided into three classes, the nobles, artisans, and agriculturists, and Theseus himself was made protector of the laws, with the supreme command of the armed force. He also built the Prytaneum, or council- hall, instituted an annual festival in commemoration of the union, enlarged the capital, and invited strangers to it, annexed to the state the territory of Megara, which came to him as heir to his grandfather Pandion, and erected a column on the isthmus of Corinth to mark the limits between Attica and Peloponnesus, near which he renewed the Isthmian games. If the account of these transactions be correct, Theseus deserves to be regarded as one of the most enlightened and meritorious of political legislators, and particularly to be celebrated as almost the only sovereign upon record who established a constitution essentially limiting the royal power to which he had a hereditary claim. These pacific triumphs, however, were not sufficient to fill a mind fired with the passion for adventure, and stimulated with the fame acquired by his great contemporary, Hercules. He quitted his throne, and sometimes in company with that hero, sometimes with Pirithous, son of Ixion, King of Thessaly, whom he had converted from an invader to a sworn friend, he undertook a variety of daring enterprizes, the relation of which is evidently mingled with a mass of fable, from which it is impossible to sift out the truth. He is said to have conquered certain Amazons on the banks of the Thermodon in Asia, a queen of whom he took to wife; to have aided Pirithous in overcoming the Centaurs in Thessaly; and with his assistance to have stolen away from Sparta the famed Helen, then a young girl; and afterwards to have joined the same friend in a similar attempt on Proserpina, the daughter of Aidoneus, King of the Molossians, in which Pirithous lost his life, and Theseus underwent an imprisonment, from which he was liberated through the intercession of Hercules. Returning from these extravagant expeditions, which exhibit him rather as a knight-errant of romance, than a sage legislator, he found his kingdom and family in confusion. Castor and Pollux, the brothers of Helen, ravaged Attica in resentment of the insult offered to her. His Queen, Phaedra, falling in love with Hippolytus, his son by the Amazon, and being rejected, calumniated him to his father, which was the occasion of the young man's death in a manner that has furnished a subject for the tragic stage. Mnestheus, the son of Peteus, and descended from Erectheus a former king of Athens, ingratiated himself with the principal citizens, and fomented discontents with the conduct of Theseus; who at length, finding that he had lost the attachment of the Athenians, quitted the city with imprecations, designing to repair to Deucalion, son of Minos, now reigning in Crete. In his passage thither he was driven by a storm to the isle of Scyros, where he was kindly received by the King, Lycomedes; but he soon after lost his life by a fall from a rock, either accidentally, or through the treachery of his host. The Athenians in after-times losing their resentment against him, only regarded him as a hero and benefactor; and Cimon the son of Miltiades, having conveyed his supposed bones to Athens in consequence of the injunction of an oracle, a magnificent temple was erected over them, which was made an asylum for the unfortunate.

,,Thrasea Paetus,Aikin,"THRASEA
 P^ETUS, a Roman senator of distinguished virtue and patriotism, to which he fell a sacrifice in the reign of Nero, was a native of Padua. He was brought up in the tenets of Stoicism, and was a warm admirer of the character of Cato of Utica, of whom he composed the life. His morals were austere with respect to himself, but indulgent towards others. Pliny, in one of his epistles, urging the maxim that we should be rigorous in passing judgment on ourselves, but lenient to the failings of others, cites a sentence of Thrasea, whom he calls "" the mildest of men,"" that "" he who hates vices, hates men."" Thrasea married Arria, the daughter of the famed Arria, wife of Csecina Psetus; and he gave his own daughter' to Helvidius Priscus, the emulator of his virtues. In his senatorial ca- 12 pacify he was a courageous asserter of all the liberty that yet remained under imperial despotism, and was of course exposed to the obloquy of all the sycophants of power. Nero himself, however, could not forbear to do justice to his integrity; and a short time before he put him to death, hearing a person accusing him of having given an unjust sentence in his case, "" I wish (said he) I were as well convinced that Thrasea loved me, as that he is an excellent judge."" Tacitus relates several interesting particulars of his conduct in the senate. When a motion was made in that assembly for permitting the LSyracusans to exceed the prescribed number of gladiators in the public spectacles, Thrasea opposed it; and some contumelious remarks being made upon his stooping to such trifling subjects of animadversion, he gave as a reason to his friends, that he had in view the honour of the senators, by making it apparent that they would not neglect great matters if brought before them, since they did not let small ones pass without notice. After Nero had committed the detestable crime of matricide, when the servile senate were decreeing solemn thanksgivings and annual festivals to commemorate the event, Thrasea, who, we are told, had been accustomed to suffer other adulations to pass in silence or with a slight assent, marked the profligacy of these motions by walking out of the senate-house; thus openly exposing his life to a danger which he contemned; for, conformably to the Stoic principles, he was used to say, "" Nero may kill me, but he cannot hurt me."" He displayed equal courage in the case of Antistius the pretor, who was convicted of publishing satirical verses against the emperor. Being impeached of treason before the senate on that account, Junius Marullus, the consul elect, moved that he should be put to death more majorum, a cruel and infamous mode of execution then obsolete. Thrasea thereupon rose, and after observing that under a clement prince, and whilst the senate lay under no particular necessity, it was not to be considered what was the utmost which the culprit deserved to suffer, he said, there were punishments appointed by the laws which might be awarded without the imputation of cruelty, or inflicting a stigma on the times; and he proposed confiscation of his effects, and banishment to an island. The freedom of Thrasea broke through 'the slavery of the other senators; and a division taking place, his opinion was supported by the whole body, with the exception of a few abandoned sycophants. The consuls, however, would not venture to carry the decree into effect without consulting Nero, who, in a reply which manifestly showed his displeasure, gave them permission to determine as they should think proper. Thrasea persisting in his motion, and the majority not choosing to recal their votes, the decree was confirmed. His political sagacity and zeal for the public good were displayed on the following occasion. A powerful Cretan was delated to the senate for various crimes, one of which was, that he had asserted it to be within his own determination, whether or not thanks should be voted to the proconsuls sent to the government of Crete. Thrasea, after giving his opinion on this individual's delinquency, made a speech in which he proposed to check the growing pride of the provincials, and their influence in the senate, by suppressing their expressions of praise to their governors, which was often false, and obtained by improper compliances; still allowing them the full privilege of accusation when they had been injuriously treated. This proposition was heard with general assent, and a decree of the senate was afterwards made on the subject. But hatred to this excellent man rankled in the breast of the imperial tyrant; and he gave an open declaration of his displeasure by forbidding him alone, of all the senators, to pay his respects at Antium on the delivery of Poppsea. Being, however, practised in dissimulation, Nero boasted to Seneca that he was reconciled to Thrasea, and was complimented by Seneca on the occasion a presage of approaching danger to both of them ! In the year 66, the 131(1 of Nero, the tyrant, having imbrued his hands in the blood of many of the most illustrious Romans, now resolved, says Tacitus, to extirpate virtue itself by the destruction of Thrasea Psetus and Bareas Soranus. An accusation was therefore brought against Thrasea by Capito Cossutianus, an infamous delator, and his personal enemy, consisting of several facts, the sum of which went to show his contempt of the base adulation of the senate, and his displeasure with the vices and enormities of the reign. From one charge it appears that during the past three years he had not entered the doors of the senate-house. The accuser employed one comparison which conveyed a high eulogy on the culprit, though invidiously applied. "" As formerly (said he) the city in its party dissensions spoke of Cassar and Cato, so now it speaks of Nero and Thrasea."" Tiridatcs King of Armenia, at this time making his entrance into Rome, and Nero returning from Campania, the city poured forth to meet the two princes. Thrasea received a command not to show himself on this occasion; but not dispirited by this proof of resentment, he sent a memorial to the emperor, desiring that he might have an opportunity of knowing and refuting the charges against him. Nero ordered the senate to be convoked, when Thrasea consulted his friends whether he ought to attempt a defence before it, or wait at home for his sentence. Different opinions were given, and Thrasea left the determination to his farther reflexions. On the next day the access to the senate-house was beset by two pretorian cohorts under arms. When the court was assembled, the accusers opened their attack, and Cossutianus was followed by Marcellus Eprius, a man of violent and fervid eloquence, who spoke with great acrimony against Thrasea. No defence was made; apparently, lest by his usual boldness of speaking he might excite the emperor's resentment against his family. It was besides manifest that his fate was decided. The conclusion was, that he and Soranus had the choice of their mode of death granted them. Thrasea was in his gardens surrounded by a number of illustrious persons of both sexes, and attentively listening to Demetrius, a Cynic philosopher, who was discoursing on the nature of the soul, and its separation from the body, when the determination of the senate was announced to him. Thrasea desired the company immediately to retire, lest they should expose themselves to join their fate with his. His wife, who wished to follow her mother's example, and die with her husband, was admonished by him not to rob their daughter of her only support, but to live for her sake. He then went forth into the portico to attend the consul's questor, and gave marks of joy on learning that his son-in-law Helviclius, who had shared in the danger, was only banished from Italy. Receiving the decree of the senate, he took Demetrius and Helvidius with him into his bed-chamber5 and laying bare the veins of both arms, he sprinkled the first blood that flowed, upon the ground, and calling the questor, said, Let us make a libation to Jupiter the Deliverer, Look on, young man; and may the gods avert the omen; but you are born at a time in which it is proper to strengthen the mind by examples of fortitude."" He then addressed the philosopher Demetrius; but the manuscript of Tacitus fails us just in the midst of this most interesting scene.

fl.,1601.0,Brahe (Tycho),Watkins,"A famous astronomer, was descended from a noble Swedish family, settled at Knudstorp in Denmark, where he was born in 1546. He studied philosophy and rhetoric, with a view of making the law his profession, but the solar eclipse, which happened in 1560, turned his attention to astronomy, which he considered as a divine study, and he applied to it with the greatest avidity. In 1565 he returned home, and in a quarrel with a Danish nobleman lost his nose, which he supplied with an artificial one, so curiously made that the defect was hardly to be perceived. About this time he applied to the study of chemistry, in hopes of finding the philosopher's stone. After this he travelled for some years, and on his return to Denmark resided with his uncle, who furnished him with the means of making celestial observations; and here it was, that in 1573 he discovered a new star in the constellation Cassiopeia. But shortly afterwards he incurred the displeasure of his relations by an imprudent marriage, and the quarrel was so great that the king was obliged to interfere to effect a reconciliation. At the royal command he read lectures on astronomy at Copenhagen. The king also gave him the isle of Huen, where he laid the foundation of an observatory, to which he gave the name of Uraniburg. The king added to the donation a pension and some lucrative places. In this situation he resided about 20 years, but on the death of the king he lost his pension, in consequence of which he left Uraniburg and went to Copenhagen, from whence he removed to Prague, where he died in 1601. He left a widow, two sons and four daughters. He was a man of great genius, but excessively superstitious, being addicted to judicial astrology, and very attentive to omens. His temper was also uncommonly irritable, and his vanity disgusting. Of the last no greater proof can be given than his inventing a system in opposition to the Copernican, and more absurd than that of Ptolemy. His works, however, shew him to have been an accurate observer. The Rudolphine Tables and the Historia Celestis, are the best.",,,,,,110.0,M,fl. (LL),55.0,,90,Tycho Brahe,T.

,,Virgil (Publius Virgilius Maro),Watkins,"Prince of the Latin poets, was born at Andes, near Mantua, about 70 years B.C. His first 11 years were spent at Cremona, from whence he removed to Rome, when his country was partitioned out among the soldiers after the battle of Philippi. There, by means of his friend Maecenas, he was introduced to Augustus, who restored to him his estate. On this occasion he wrote his first Eclogue; and on completing the Bucolics, he undertook the Georgics. After these were finished, and had been read by Augustus, he began the Aeneid, at the request of the emperor. This great poem has left the palm of superiority undecided between Homer and Virgil. The poet was engaged eleven years upon this immortal work but died without revising, it, at Brundisium, B.C. 19, and in the 51st year of his age. He left the greatest part of his property to Maecenas, Tucca, and Augustus. His remains were interred on the road leading from Naples to Puteoli, and the following epitaph was inscribed on his tomb: Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nune Partbenope; cecini paseua, rura, duces. Virgil was of a remarkably timorous disposition; and as a proof of his modesty, the following anecdote is recorded. Having written this distich on his patron, Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane: Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar babet, he placed it in the night on the gate of the palace. Enquiries were made by Augustus after the author of so fine a compliment, when Bathyllus, a miserable poet, avowed the verses, and obtained the reward. On this Virgil again wrote the same verses, and under them, Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter bonores; with the beginning of another line in these words, Sic vos non vobis, four times repeated. Augustus desired to have these lines completed, which Bathyllus could not effect. Virgil then finished them in this order: Sic vos non vobis nidificatis aves; Sic vos non vobis vellera fertis oves; Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes; Sic vos non vobis fertis aratra boves. Having this proved himself the author of distich, he received a reward, and the usurper was banished. The best editions of Virgil are Baskerville's 4to, Birmingham, 1757; the Variorum, 8vo. 1661; and Glasgow, 12mo, 1758. This poet has been translated into English by Dryden, Pitt, and Warton.",,,Biog.

He received his education in the crypt school at Gloucester, and afterwards became servitor in Pembroke College, Oxford. Dr. Benson, Bishop of Gloucester, ordained him, after which his zeal prompted him to preach in prisons, private houses, the fields, and open streets. A course so strange and irregular could not but give great offense, and the doors of the churches were universally shut against him. His eloquence was peculiarly strong and well adapted to make a great impression upon ordinary minds; in consequence of which he obtained many followers. In 1738, he went to America, where he was well received, and wonderful effects are recorded in his journals on the power of his preaching. Sudden and violent conversions were considered as indispensably necessary to prove that the hearers had obtained divine grace. For some time, Mr. Whitefield acted in conjunction with the two Wesleys, but at last serious differences arose between them regarding the Calvinistic doctrines of absolute election and final perseverance. These were zealously maintained by Mr. Whitefield and his followers, and as strenuously denied by the others. A division arose, and the Methodists were divided into two parties, called the Calvinistic and Arminian Methodists. Mr. Whitefield built two large conventicles in London, one called the Tabernacle in the city, and another in Tottenham Court Road. He was also powerfully assisted by the countess of Huntingdon, who appointed him her chaplain and became the patroness of the sect, which still continues in a flourishing state.

,,"Whytt, Robert",Aikin,"An eminent physician, born in Edinburgh in 1714, received his academic education at St. Andrew's. He studied medicine first in Edinburgh, and later in London, Paris, and Leyden. He established his medical practice in Edinburgh, where he became a Fellow and later the president of the College of Physicians. In 1746, he was elected to the chair of the institutions of medicine at the university. He gained fame both as a private practitioner and as a medical educator and published several ingenious works. His first work was an ""Essay on the Vital and other Involuntary Motions of Animals"" in 1751. His theory differed from Stahl's, attributing these motions not to the soul acting toward a predetermined end but to the power of stimulus. In 1755, he published ""Physiological Essays, containing an Inquiry into the Causes which promote the Circulation of the Fluids in the very small Vessels of Animals; with Observations on the Sensibility and Irritability of the Parts of Man and other Animals."" In this work, he proposed that the action of the heart alone isn't sufficient to propel blood through the tiniest vessels and that it's assisted by an oscillatory motion of the vessels themselves. He also challenged some of Haller's conclusions regarding sensibility and irritability. An expanded edition of this work was published in 1761. Dr. Whytt also published ""An Essay on the Virtues of Lime-water in the Cure of the Stone"" in 1752, ""Observations on the Nature, Cause, and Cure of those Disorders which are commonly called Nervous, Hypochondriac, and Hysteric"" in 1764, and contributed papers to the Edinburgh ""Essays and Observations, Physiological and Literary."" After his death, ""Observations on the Dropsy of the Brain"" was published. All of his practical works contain precise descriptions and judicious remarks. He suffered from chronic illnesses for a long time and passed away in 1766. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and the first physician to the King in Scotland. An edition of all his works was published by his son in 1768 in 4to, under the supervision of Sir John Pringle, who is credited with softening some of the harsh expressions used in the controversy between Whytt and Haller.

,,Wickliffe (John de),Watkins,"A celebrated divine, and called the morning star of the Reformation, was born about 1324, in the parish of Wickliffe, in Yorkshire. He was admitted first to Queen's College but afterwards removed to Merton College, Oxford. In 1361, his great talents procured him the mastership of Balliol College; and four years after, he was made warden of Canterbury Hall, then founded by Archbishop Islip, whose successor, Langham, displaced him at the instigation of the monks, who were the worst foes to Wickliffe for exposing their corrupt errors and practices. The pope having cited King Edward to Avignon for refusing to pay him a yearly tribute, the monks defended the papal claim, which Wickliffe opposed with such strength that he was made the king's chaplain and preferred to the rectory of Lutterworth, in Leicestershire. In 1374, he was sent, with some others, on an embassy to Rome to complain of the number of benefices in England enjoyed by foreigners. This mission, however, produced no other effect than to confirm Wickliffe in his sentiments of the papal tyranny. After his return, he preached with even greater vehemence against the corruptions of the Roman church. Pope Gregory XI, being informed of his conduct, issued several bulls against him, charging him with numerous heresies. An assembly was accordingly held at St. Paul's by Archbishop Sudbury and Courtenay, Bishop of London, to examine Wickliffe, who appeared, supported by the Duke of Lancaster and Lord Percy. Wickliffe made an able defense of himself, but the council ended without any determination. Wickliffe died in 1334 and was buried in his church at Lutterworth, but forty years afterward his bones were taken up and burnt by order of the council of Constance. He wrote a treatise on the Schism of the Popes and translated the New Testament into English.

,,Wolfe (James),Watkins,"A celebrated commander, was the son of general Edward Wolfe, and born at Westerham, in Kent, in 1726. He entered young into the army, and possessing great military talents, improved by assiduity and experience, soon distinguished himself as a brave and skillful officer. He was present at the battle of Lafeldt, and in every subsequent engagement in Germany, in the war which terminated at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. When lieutenant-colonel of Kingsley's regiment, he brought it to such exact discipline, that as long as the six battalions on the plain of Minden are recorded in history, the Hand of that regiment will be remembered to his honor. He was greatly instrumental to the taking of Louisburg, and was fiercely returned from thence when he was appointed to the chief command of the important expedition against Quebec in 1759. This undertaking afforded ample scope for the exercise of his great military talents. But he was mortally wounded in the moment of victory, on the news of which he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and laid, ""I thank God; I die contented.""

The same historian says, that on certain festal days they chose by lot several persons, who were to be sent as messengers to Zamolxis, and whom they put to death, by throwing them up in the air, and catching them on the points of their spears; a circumstance not improbable among a barbarous people, who are known to have practised human sacrifices.",,,,,,114.0,HP,fl.,,,116,Zamolxis,Zamolxis,17.0,Divines and Metaphysicians &cc,,99.0,male,2473.0,A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmoxis,-550.0,-505.0,case3

fl.,-463.0,Zeno the Eleatic,Aikin,"a Grecian philosopher, born at Elea, in Magna Graecia, flourished about 463 B.C. He was a disciple of Parmenides, and by some is said to have been his adopted son. Continuing to reside in his native city, which, small as it was, he preferred to Athens, as allowing of more independence, he became a celebrated master in the Eleatic sect. Some have erroneously ascribed to him the invention of the dialectic art; it is however certain that he displayed much subtlety in those logical argumentations, which were afterwards reduced to rule by Aristotle and others. He was a zealous friend of civil liberty, and is supposed to have lost his life in opposing a tyrant. There are so many different narrations of this event, that some have doubted the whole fact, yet it seems verified by the concurrent voice of antiquity. The substance appears to have been, that having been detected in a conspiracy against the petty tyrant of his native place, he endured the most cruel torments without betraying his accomplices; and that at length his countrymen, roused by the example of his fortitude, fell upon the usurper and stoned him to death. According to Aristotle, Zeno taught that nothing can be produced either from that which is similar or dissimilar: that there is only one being, which is God; and that this being is eternal, homogeneous, and spherical: that there are many worlds: that in nature there is no vacuum: that all bodies are composed of four elements, heat, moisture, cold, and dryness: that the body of man is from the earth, and his soul is composed of an equal mixture of the four elements. He employed all his subtlety in arguing against the possibility of motion; and according to the representation of Seneca, he carried his scepticism so far as to deny the real existence of external objects. In reality, he seems, to have accustomed himself so much to reason on both sides of a question, and to have been so destitute of precise and definite notions, that it is impossible to determine what sense he put upon his words, and whether he admitted or rejected a properly divine nature. His practical philosophy is depreciated by Bayle from his justification of the warmth with which he resented reproach: ""If I were indifferent to censure (said he) I should also be indifferent to praise"": yet it is perhaps too much to be expected from a philosopher that he should extinguish all sensibility of the opinion expressed of him by his fellow creatures. His writings appear to have been in great esteem among the ancients, but none of them have reached modern times.",,,,,,115.0,HP,fl.,,,108,Zeno of Elea,Zeno Ele:,9.0,Divines and Metaphysicians &cc,Italy,99.0,male,2478.0,A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea,-493.0,-448.0,case3
