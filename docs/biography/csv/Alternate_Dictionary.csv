1,AGAMEMNON,"The story of this early Grecian monarch is less intermixed with fabulous or incredible circumstances than that of most of the heroes engaged in the Trojan war. He was the son according to Homer, the grandson according to Herodotus, of Atreus, whom he succeeded in the realms of Argos and Mycenae. On account of the comparative extent and power of his dominions, he was chosen supreme commander of the confederate army destined against Troy, which expedition commenced, according to the Usherian chronology, 1194 years B.C.. On arriving with the fleet at Aulis, the winds for a long time proved contrary; when, in conformity to the cruel superstition of such an age, the soothsayer Calchas enjoined the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia, as a propitiatory offering to Diana. His compliance with the barbarous order is said to have been the cause of the fatal hatred of his wife Clytaemnestni towards him. During the long war with Troy he fulfilled the duties of a prince and general, though his unjust treatment of Achilles, in taking from him Briseïs, was the cause of many evils to the Greeks. On his return, bringing with him Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, as a concubine, he was received with a treacherous welcome by Clytaemnestra, who had formed a guilty connection with Egisthus, and was assassinated by that prince, his relation, his own wife assisting in the deed, and triumphing in her vengeance. His son Orestes afterwards took revenge on the murderers; and the events of horror afforded by the history of this family have been favourite subjects of the tragic muse of ancient Greece, and its imitators in modern times.",Aikin,Bayle.

2,"ALDROVANDI, ULYSSES","a celebrated naturalist, called the modern Pliny, was born at Bologna, in 1522, of a family descended from the counts of the same name. He very early displayed his inclination for travelling, by accompanying on foot, as far as the shrine of St. James of Compostella, a pilgrim whom he accidentally met with not far from home. He pursued his studies partly at Bologna and partly at Padua, and there was no science which his inquisitive disposition did not lead him to cultivate. Falling into some suspicion respecting his religious opinions, he made a journey to Rome in 1550 in order to clear himself; and there attentively studied the antiquities of the place, and drew up a treatise on the ancient statues, which he gave to his friend Lucio Mauro, with whose work on Roman antiquities it was printed. He there likewise made an acquaintance with Rondelezio, whose researches into the history of fishes gave him a taste for the knowledge of nature. Returning to Bologna he applied himself to botany, and went to Pisa to obtain further instructions in it from Ghini, the professor in that branch. He graduated in physic at Bologna in 1553, and on the following year was appointed to the chairs of logic and philosophy, and to the extraordinary lectureship of botany, which in 1561 was made ordinary. By his interest the botanical garden of Bologna was founded in 1567, of which he had the superintendence. Besides attending to the duties of his station, he employed infinite labour in accumulating all the information concerning natural history that the age could afford, collecting books of all kinds, making numerous journeys, and establishing correspondences with the learned all over Europe. He likewise, at great expense, formed a museum of rare and curious productions, and kept several of the best artists in his employ for several years in delineating them. The fruit of these toils was a prodigious collection of matter relative to all the kingdoms of nature, of which in his life-time he published four folio volumes, with plates; three of them on ornithology, and one on insects. One volume on bloodless animals, and one on fishes, were likewise composed by him. The rest published under his name, which make the whole number thirteen volumes, and treat on serpents, quadrupeds, monsters, metals, and trees, are compilations by other persons chiefly from materials which he left behind him. Notwithstanding he was aided by several princes, and by the senate of Bologna, in these expensive pursuits, he lived to exhaust all his property, and is said to have died, at the age of eighty-three, blind, and in an alms-house. He bequeathed to his country all his vast collections; of which a catalogue was printed in Italian in 1648. His museum formed the basis of that now existing at Bologna, and many of his specimens are still in being. His memory is held in great honour at his native place. His works are defective in method and selection, and abound in superfluities and matter of dubious authority; yet natural history owes him great obligations for his indefatigable industry and munificent patronage. The illustrious Buffon calls him the most laborious and learned of all the naturalists, and praises the plan and distribution of his work, and the exactness of his descriptions. Besides his manuscripts in natural history, he left copious writings upon almost every branch of the arts and sciences; which proves his disposition, like that of Pliny, to have rather been towards collection and compilation, than towards the exercise of the judgment.",Aikin,Moreri. Tiraboschi. - A.,161
3,"AMMONIUS, son of Hermias","a Peripatetic philosopher, flourished at the beginning of the sixth century, and taught at Alexandria under the reign of Anastasius. He was a disciple of Proclus, and a preceptor of Simplicius, Philoponus, and Damascius; the latter of whom speaks of him as superior to the other philosophers of his age, and as particularly excelling in mathematical learning. He wrote commentaries upon Aristotle and Porphyry, which are still extant. His commentary on Aristotle's book, De Interpretatione, was published, in folio, by Aldus, at Venice, in 1503. An extract from this work, on the subject of Providence, was published separately by Grotuis, at Paris, in 1648. His commentary, ""In Isagogen Porphyrii,"" was printed by Aldus, in folio, at Venice, in 1500, and has passed through several editions.",Aikin,Fabric. Bibl. Graec. lib. iv. c. 25. s. 12. Suidas.

4,ARION,"a personage of great celebrity in the poetical story of antiquity, was a native of Methymne in the isle of Lesbos, where he attained high reputation, about B.C. 620, as a musician and poet. He is said to have been the inventor of the dithyrambic measure, and to have excelled in lyric poetry, which he sung to his lute. He was in great favour with Periander king of Corinth, who long entertained him at his court, and treated him with distinguished kindness. Thence he visited Italy and Sicily, practising in his profession, and accumulating by it great riches. Meaning to return to Greece, he embarked in a Corinthian vessel with all his effects. The sailors, tempted by such a prey, when out at sea, conspired to take his life, and were proceeding to throw him overboard, when he requested to be permitted to sing one funeral strain before his death. They complied; and standing on the prow, dressed in his robe of ceremony, with his instrument in his hand, he  chanted with a loud voice his sweetest elegy, and threw himself into the sea. A dolphin (says the fable), charmed with his music, swam to him while floating on the waves, bore him up on his back, and carried him safely to Cape Taenarus in Sparta, whence he returned to his patron Periander. The sailors, who thought him dead, put in at Corinth, and, being confounded by his appearance against them, paid the penalty of their cruel purpose with their lives. This story seems to have been universally credited by antiquity, and has been a frequent subject of poetry and sculpture.",Aikin,Herodot. Aulus Gellius. Moreri. - A.,379
5,AUTOLYCUS,"a Greek mathematician and astronomer, of Pitane in Aeolia, flourished about 320 years before Christ. He was preceptor in mathematics to Arcesilaus, who was also a disciple of Theophrastus, the successor of Aristotle. The personal history of this philosopher is little known, but two works of his remain, which prove him to have been an eminent mathematician: the first a treatise ""On the Sphere,"" edited by Dasypodius in Greek and Latin, in 8vo. at Strasburg in 1572; and given in a Latin translation, in the ""Synopsis Mathematica"" of Mersennus, published in 4to. at Paris in 1644; the second, a treatise ""On the rising and setting of the Planets,"" edited with the former work by Dasypodius.",Aikin,Diogen.

6,"LAELIUS, CAIUS","surnamed the Wise, supposed to have been the son of the preceding, was equally distinguished with the former by his friendship with the second Scipio Africanus. He was likewise an eminent orator, and a cultivator of polite literature, having been a disciple of Diogenes the Stoic, and of Panaerius. He signalized his courage in the war against Viriathus in Spain, but was chiefly known by his civil honours. His oratory is by Cicero described as of the mild and elegant kind, to which his temper of mind was adapted; for he is said never on any occasion to have displayed a change of countenance. His surname, according to Cicero, was derived from the philosophic temperance of his mode of living; but Plutarch ascribes it to the prudence with which he dropped a project for improving the condition of the plebeians, when he found that it would meet with a violent opposition. He was a member of the college of augurs, and pronounced one of his most famous orations in that capacity. He attained the consulship in the year B.C. 140. When his friend Scipio quitted all concern in public affairs, Laelius accompanied him to his country retreat of Liternum, where these two great men were not ashamed, according to Cicero's expression, to grow boys again, and divert themselves with throwing pebbles on the sea shore. That writer has immortalized their connexion by making it the base of his dialogue on friendship, in which Laelius appears as the chief speaker. He passed a long life in conjugal union with a single wife, in whom was centered all his attachment to the sex. He is supposed to have had a share in the composition, or, at least, the correction, of Terencc's comedies.",Aikin,Cicero de Oratore & Clar. Orat. &c. Plutarch. Vossii Poet. Lat. - A.,3404
7,"MARCELLUS, M. CLAUDIUS","A Roman general, who, by gaining an advantage over Annibal, first taught his countrymen that the Carthaginian commander was not invincible. He was afterward sent into Sicily, where he rendered his name illustrious by the capture of Syracuse, notwithstanding at the mechanical skill of the mathematician Archimedes. He was then called up for a second time to encounter Annibal, by whom, after various success, he was killed in an ambuscade in the 60th year of his age, and in his fifth consulship U.C. 546, A.C. 208.",Crabb,"Polyb. 1.2;

8,MENELAUS,"A celebrated mathematician who flourished under the reign of the emperor Trajan, was of Grecian extraction, and a native of Alexandria. He is called a geometrician by Ptolemy, who informs us, in the sixth book of his ""Almagest,"" that he made astronomical observations at Rome in the first year of Trajan, corresponding with the year ninety-eight of the Christian era. He is thought to be the Menelaus whom Plutarch has made an interlocutor in his dialogue ""De Facie quae in Orbe Lunae apparet."" He was the author of three books ""On Spherics,"" or spherical Figures, which has descended to modern times through the medium of the Arabic language. Of this work father Mersonne edited the first Latin version at Paris, in 1664, in quarto, from a corrupt copy, with the requisite corrections, restorations, and additional illustrative propositions. This treatise in Arabic is inserted by father Labbé in the first volume of his ""Nov. Catal. Manuscriptorum."" ",Aikin,"Fabricii Bibl, Graec. vol. II. lib. iii. cap. v. sect. 17. - M.",4037
9,MESUE the Elder,"Was the son of an apothecary of Nisabour in Khorasan, and flourished in the ninth century. He was a Christian of the Nestorian sect, and was brought up under the physician Gabriel the son of Backtishua, who procured him the appointment of physician to the hospital in his native city. When Almamon, the son of the caliph Haroun al Raschid, was governor of Khorasan, he placed Mesue at the head of a college of learned men which he instituted; and after his accession to the caliphate in 813, he brought him into Syria, and made him a professor of medicine at Bagdat, which situation he occupied a great number of years. He was also employed in translating the works of the ancients into Arabic, a service to science very meritoriously promoted by Almamon. He wrote works of his own which are cited by Rhazes and other authors, but which appear to have perished, as those extant under the name of Mesue do not correspond to the citations. Some suppose he was the same person with Johannes Damascenus.",Aikin,,4058
10,JASON,"a hero in the semi-fabulous age of Greece, was the son of Aeson king of Thessaly. On his father's death or retreat from government, the guardianship of Jason and regency of the kingdom were committed to Pelias, the maternal brother of Aeson. The young prince was sent for education to Chiron, whom fable has represented as a centaur. When he was grown to manhood, Pelias, desirous of securing the kingdom to himself, sent Jason on the expedition which has made his name so famous, under the title of the Argonautic, and the object of which was to bring a certain golden fleece from Colchis, a country at the extremity of the Euxine or Black sea, the modern Mingrelia. It has been a subject of various conjecture what the fabulists have disguised under the fiction of the golden-fleece; the most probable supposition seems to be, that the particles of gold washed down from the mountains by certain streams in that country were received upon fleeces sunk in their beds, and that the fame of the riches obtained in this manner had reached Greece, and excited a desire of pillage. Such an opinion seems more conformable to the character of those heroic ages, than that of a commercial voyage to bring back either an extraordinary breed of fine-woolled sheep, or any article of woollen manufacture. The intended expedition being made known through Greece, brought a number of young men of the first families to join it as adventurers, and many names of the most celebrated of the early heroes are found among them. A galley of fifty oars was equipped in the Pagasean bay, which was named after its builder, the Argo. This is generally represented as the sole vessel; but some accounts, more probably, relate that several others were fitted out for the enterprise. This memorable voyage is by most chronologers dated in the thirteenth century B.C. The adventures that befel the navigators in their voyage have given great scope for poetical fiction and exaggeration, in which there is probably a foundation of traditionary truth. Those which ensued after their arrival at Colchis are still more obscured by the marvellous; but we may gather that the Argonauts succeeded in their purpose, partly by their own valour, and partly by the assistance of Medea, daughter of the king Aetes, who fell in love with Jason, and accompanied him on his return. Jason found Pelias established on the throne of Thessaly; and after his death, Acastus, his son, who succeeded him, expelled Jason and Medea from the country. They retired to Corinth, where they lived several years in peace under the protection of the king Glaucus, or Creon. At length Creon having given his daughter as a second wife to Jason, the jealous rage of Medea induced her to kill her two children by him, and set the palace on fire, in which it is said that Jason, with his new wife, was consumed. Other writers tell the story differently, and suppose them to have been afterwards reconciled. It is impossible to ascertain the exact truth respecting the latter history of this hero amidst so many varying narrations of poets and fabulists; but the preceding narrative seems on the whole to possess the greatest share of probability.",Aikin,Univers.

11,"PALESTRINA, GIOVANNI PIERLUIGI DA","A very eminent composer of church-music, was born in 1529, at Palestrina in Italy, the ancient Praeneste. His instructor in the musical science is said to have been one Gaudio Mell, a Fleming, in which name some have recognized Claude Gondimel, a musician of Franche Comté; but the identity of these is a point of uncertainty. Of Giovanni's early life nothing is known; but it appears, that in 1555 he was admitted into the pope's chapel in Rome. He had already formed that simple, grave, and noble style for which he became so famous; for we are told that the pope and conclave having been scandalized at the light and injudicious manner in which the mass had been usually set and performed, had determined to banish music in parts entirely from the church; but that Palestrina, at the age of twenty-six, during the pontificate of Marcellus Cervinus, interceded with his holiness to suspend the sentence till he should have heard a mass composed in a different style. Accordingly, at Easter 1555, he presented before the pope and cardinals his celebrated composition, entitled, ""Missa Papae Marcelli,"" which was heard by them with so much pleasure and admiration, that music in divine service was restored to favour. In 1562 Palestrina was elected chapel-master to the church of Santa Maria-Maggiore; and in 1571 was appointed to the same office at St. Peter's. He opened a school of music at Rome in conjunction with his friend and fellow-pupil Gio. Maria Nanino, and greatly contributed to establish the superior reputation of the Italian musicians. He died in 1594, and was interred at St. Peter's, whither his funeral was attended by all the musicians at Rome, and a great concourse of other persons. His own composition, ""Libera nos Domine,"" was performed on the occasion. No musician has been mentioned with more honour by writers on the same science than Palestrina, who was undoubtedly a great and original genius. Although the inventions of fugue, canon, and other elaborate compositions, have been banished from dramatic music, they have been retained in the church, on account of their gravity and solemnity; and this composer, by his fine taste and admirable skill in harmony, brought choral music to a degree of perfection that, (says Dr. Burney,) has never been exceeded. The best church compositions since his time, have, indeed, been proverbially called alla Palestrina, as professedly imitations of his manner. His works were numerous, and most of them are still extant. The principal of them are masses and motels.",Aikin,Hawkin's and Burny's Histories of Music. - A.,4583
12,PHILOSTRATUS,"a Greek sophist, was a native probably of Lemnos, though he is also called an Athenian and a Tyrian. He came to Rome in the reign of Severus, about the year 200, and was employed by the Empress Julia to compile a life of the famous philosopher Apollonius of Tyana. In the article of that extraordinary man some account is given of this work, which is written in the declamatory style of a rhetorician, and totally without judgment, abounding with marvellous and absurd tales. It, however, conferred celebrity on the author, and has survived to modern times. Philostratus also wrote a work entitled ""Icones,"" being a collection of descriptions, in a florid but pure and elegant style. A nephew of this writer, also named Philostratus, who lived in the time of Heliogabalus, was the author of lives of the sophists, now extant. The best edition of the works of Philostratus is that of Gothofr.",Aikin,"Olearius, Gr. Lat. Lips. 1709. Vossii Hist. Gr. Bibliogr. Dict. - A.",4882
13,THEODORUS,"an ecclesiastical historian and reader in the great church at Constantinople, on which account he was styled Anagnostes, flourished about the year 525. He made an extract from the ecclesiastical histories of Socrates, Sozomen and Theodoret, in two books, which is still in manuscript; and afterwards continued the history of the church, in two more books, from the latter period of Theodosius the Younger to the time of the Emperor Justinian. These two books have been lost, and nothing of them remains but extracts, which were collected, together with some other fragments of the same writer, by Henry Valois, and published under the following title: ""Excerpta ex ecclesiastica Historia Theodori Lectoris et Fragmenta alia: Henrico Valesio interprete, cum ejusdem et aliorum Annotationibus,"" printed with Reading's edition of the Ecclesiastical History of Theodoret, Cambridge, 1720, fol.",Aikin,Hamberger's Zuverlässige Nachrichten von den vornehmsten Schriftstellern vom anfange der Welt bis 1500. - J.,5823
14,THEODORUS PRODROMUS,"or, as he is called, Cyrus Theodorus Predromus, and, in some manuscripts, Ptochoprodromus, a Greek monk, flourished at Constantinople about the beginning of the twelfth century. He was descended from a respectable family, and speaks of his having a bishop as his maternal uncle. It appears by his numerous works, the greater part of which are still in manuscript, that he was a man of considerable learning, and possessed a genius for poetry, which led him to cultivate the muses; but in his poetical attempts he does not seem to have been very successful. It appears also that he had some connection with the orphan-house at Constantinople, in which, in all probability, he was a teacher; but if we may judge from some of his verses he lived in a state of great poverty. He was the author of various works, written between the years 1118 and 1143, of which several are contained in a collection entitled, ""Theodori Prodromi Epigrammata ut vetustissima ita piissima, quibus omnia utriusque Testamenti Capita felicissime comprehenduntur, cum aliis nonullis,"" Basiliae, 1536. 8vo. Of some others the following editions have been printed: "" Rhodanthes et Dosiclis Amorum, Libri IX. Graece et Latine Interprete Gilb. Gaulmino;"" Paris, 1625, 8vo. ; "" Dialogus Amarantus, sive Senilis Amor, interprete Gilb. Gaulmino;"" printed with the preceding; ""Dissertatio de Sapientia, F.

15,THEODOSIUS,"an ancient mathematician, a native of Tripoli in Africa, flourished, in all probability, about the second or third century. He applied chiefly to those parts of the mathematics which relate to the doctrine of the sphere, and on that subject wrote three books, the first containing twenty-two propositions; the second twenty-three, and the third fourteen, all demonstrated in the pure geometrical manner of the ancients. The author's object in this work was to establish the geometrical principles of astronomy, and to explain the different phenomena of which it treats. With this view he did what Euclid had done in regard to the elements of geometry. He collected into one body the different propositions discovered before his time by astronomers and geometricians, for there is great reason to suppose that the theory was then little known, and understood only in an imperfect manner. These books were much used by Ptolemy, as well as by succeeding writers, and were translated by the Arabians into their own language from the original Greek. From the Arabic, the work was again, translated into Latin, and printed at Venice; but the Arabic version being very defective, a more complete edition was published in Greek and Latin at Paris in 1556, 4to., by John Pena, regius professor of astronomy. The works of Theodosius were commented on and illustrated also by Clavius, Hologanius and Guarinus; and by De Chales in his Cursus Mathematicus. But the edition of Theodosius's Spherics, now chiefly used is that of the learned Dr. Barrow, published in the year 1675, illustrated and demonstrated in a new and concise method. From this author's account, Theodosius appears not only to have been a great master in the more difficult parts of geometry, but the first considerable author of antiquity who wrote upon the same subject. He was the author also of two other treatises; one entitled ""De Habitationibus,"" and the other ""De Diebus et Noctibus,"" which contain geometrical demonstrations of the phenomena that must appear to the inhabitants of different parts of the earth. Greek copies of these were preserved in the King's library at Paris, and a Latin edition of them was published by Peter Dasypodius in 1572. ",Aikin,"Jöcher's Allgem. Gelehrt.

16,Theseus,"A celebrated hero in the semifabulous ages of Greece, is placed by chronologers in the 13th century B.C.. Amidst the fables in which his history is enveloped, the following narrative may approach the nearest to credibility. He was the son of Aegeus King of Athens, who having no legitimate children, appears to have had a secret connection with Aethra, daughter of Pittheus, King of Troezern, when he was paying a visit to that prince. On his departure, he left a sword and other tokens, directing Aethra, that if the child of which she was pregnant should prove a male, he should at a proper age be sent to Athens with these tokens, that he might be recognized. Young Theseus, on growing up, displayed a courageous spirit in a vigorous frame ; and when he had acquired strength sufficient to lift a great stone under which the tokens were placed, they were given to him, and the secret of his parentage was revealed to him. His mother and grandfather advised him to proceed to Athens by sea, in order to avoid the dangers by land through a country overrun by robbers; but these hazards only stimulated his enterprizing disposition. In his journey he met with several adventures which have been related by poets and fabulists, in all of which he came off victorious. He arrived at Athens, where he found the court of Aegeus agitated by dissensions. The sons of Pallas, the King's brother, who were numerous and powerful, were impatient under the rule of a childless old man, and in the apprehension that he would adopt this valiant stranger for his heir, they endeavoured to fill his mind with suspicions of him. They were so successful, that Aegeus had prepared poison for him, when he was discovered to his father by means of his tokens, and the consequence was a revolt of the Pallantides, which Theseus suppressed. At this time Athens was under the obligation of paying a tribute at stated periods of seven youths and virgins to Minos, King of Crete, as a penalty for the death of his son Androgeus, who was supposed to have been killed by the Athenians. These young persons are fabulously said to have been destined for victims to a monster called the Minotaur, confined in a labyrinth; but the Cretans affirm that they were given as prizes to the victors in certain games celebrated in honour of Androgeus. Whatever were their fate, the exacted tribute filled the principal families of Athens with mourning; and Theseus was resolved upon an attempt to free the city from such a disgraceful imposition. Causing himself to be enrolled among the victims, he was conveyed to Crete; where, as the story relates, he slew the Minotaur, and escaped from the labyrinth by means of a clue furnished by the King's daughter, Ariadne; but, according to the more probable narration, he vanquished at the games the royal champion, Taurus, and through the admiration excited by his valour obtained a remission of the tribute, with Ariadne for a wife. Returning to Athens, he succeeded to the crown on the death of Aegeus, when, taking example from what he had observed in Crete, then the most civilized and flourishing of the Grecian states, he consolidated the twelve towns of Attica, founded by Cecrops, into one government, of which Athens was the head, and gave the nation a constitution, by which the legislative power was placed in a general assembly of the people divided into three classes, the nobles, artisans, and agriculturists, and Theseus himself was made protector of the laws, with the supreme command of the armed force. He also built the Prytaneum, or council- hall, instituted an annual festival in commemoration of the union, enlarged the capital, and invited strangers to it, annexed to the state the territory of Megara, which came to him as heir to his grandfather Pandion, and erected a column on the isthmus of Corinth to mark the limits between Attica and Peloponnesus, near which he renewed the Isthmian games. If the account of these transactions be correct, Theseus deserves to be regarded as one of the most enlightened and meritorious of political legislators, and particularly to be celebrated as almost the only sovereign upon record who established a constitution essentially limiting the royal power to which he had a hereditary claim. These pacific triumphs, however, were not sufficient to fill a mind fired with the passion for adventure, and stimulated with the fame acquired by his great contemporary, Hercules. He quitted his throne, and sometimes in company with that hero, sometimes with Pirithous, son of Ixion, King of Thessaly, whom he had converted from an invader to a sworn friend, he undertook a variety of daring enterprizes, the relation of which is evidently mingled with a mass of fable, from which it is impossible to sift out the truth. He is said to have conquered certain Amazons on the banks of the Thermodon in Asia, a queen of whom he took to wife; to have aided Pirithous in overcoming the Centaurs in Thessaly; and with his assistance to have stolen away from Sparta the famed Helen, then a young girl; and afterwards to have joined the same friend in a similar attempt on Proserpina, the daughter of Aidoneus, King of the Molossians, in which Pirithous lost his life, and Theseus underwent an imprisonment, from which he was liberated through the intercession of Hercules. Returning from these extravagant expeditions, which exhibit him rather as a knight-errant of romance, than a sage legislator, he found his kingdom and family in confusion. Castor and Pollux, the brothers of Helen, ravaged Attica in resentment of the insult offered to her. His Queen, Phaedra, falling in love with Hippolytus, his son by the Amazon, and being rejected, calumniated him to his father, which was the occasion of the young man's death in a manner that has furnished a subject for the tragic stage. Mnestheus, the son of Peteus, and descended from Erectheus a former king of Athens, ingratiated himself with the principal citizens, and fomented discontents with the conduct of Theseus; who at length, finding that he had lost the attachment of the Athenians, quitted the city with imprecations, designing to repair to Deucalion, son of Minos, now reigning in Crete. In his passage thither he was driven by a storm to the isle of Scyros, where he was kindly received by the King, Lycomedes; but he soon after lost his life by a fall from a rock, either accidentally, or through the treachery of his host. The Athenians in after-times losing their resentment against him, only regarded him as a hero and benefactor; and Cimon the son of Miltiades, having conveyed his supposed bones to Athens in consequence of the injunction of an oracle, a magnificent temple was erected over them, which was made an asylum for the unfortunate. Its remains still subsist as one of the noblest relics of ancient art in that renowned capital.",Aikin,Plutarch Vit. Thesei. Univers. Hist. Voy. de Jeune Anacharsis. - A.,5837
17,Thrasea Paetus,"THRASEA
P^ETUS, a Roman senator of distinguished virtue and patriotism, to which he fell a sacrifice in the reign of Nero, was a native of Padua. He was brought up in the tenets of Stoicism, and was a warm admirer of the character of Cato of Utica, of whom he composed the life. His morals were austere with respect to himself, but indulgent towards others. Pliny, in one of his epistles, urging the maxim that we should be rigorous in passing judgment on ourselves, but lenient to the failings of others, cites a sentence of Thrasea, whom he calls "" the mildest of men,"" that "" he who hates vices, hates men."" Thrasea married Arria, the daughter of the famed Arria, wife of Csecina Psetus ; and he gave his own daughter' to Helvidius Priscus, the emulator of his virtues. In his senatorial ca- 12 pacify he was a courageous asserter of all the liberty that yet remained under imperial despotism, and was of course exposed to the obloquy of all the sycophants of power. Nero himself, however, could not forbear to do justice to his integrity; and a short time before he put him to death, hearing a person accusing him of having given an unjust sentence in his case, "" I wish (said he) I were as well convinced that Thrasea loved me, as that he is an excellent judge."" Tacitus relates several interesting particulars of his conduct in the senate. When a motion was made in that assembly for permitting the LSyracusans to exceed the prescribed number of gladiators in the public spectacles, Thrasea opposed it; and some contumelious remarks being made upon his stooping to such trifling subjects of animadversion, he gave as a reason to his friends, that he had in view the honour of the senators, by making it apparent that they would not neglect great matters if brought before them, since they did not let small ones pass without notice. After Nero had committed the detestable crime of matricide, when the servile senate were decreeing solemn thanksgivings and annual festivals to commemorate the event, Thrasea, who, we are told, had been accustomed to suffer other adulations to pass in silence or with a slight assent, marked the profligacy of these motions by walking out of the senate-house ; thus openly exposing his life to a danger which he contemned ; for, conformably to the Stoic principles, he was used to say, "" Nero may kill me, but he cannot hurt me."" He displayed equal courage in the case of Antistius the pretor, who was convicted of publishing satirical verses against the emperor. Being impeached of treason before the senate on that account, Junius Marullus, the consul elect, moved that he should be put to death more majorum, a cruel and infamous mode of execution then obsolete. Thrasea thereupon rose, and after observing that under a clement prince, and whilst the senate lay under no particular necessity, it was not to be considered what was the utmost which the culprit deserved to suffer, he said, there were punishments appointed by the laws which might be awarded without the imputation of cruelty, or inflicting a stigma on the times ; and he proposed confiscation of his effects, and banishment to an island. The freedom of Thrasea broke through 'the slavery of the other senators ; and a division taking place, his opinion was supported by the whole body, with the exception of a few abandoned sycophants. The consuls, however, would not venture to carry the decree into effect without consulting Nero, who, in a reply which manifestly showed his displeasure, gave them permission to determine as they should think proper. Thrasea persisting in his motion, and the majority not choosing to recal their votes, the decree was confirmed. His political sagacity and zeal for the public good were displayed on the following occasion. A powerful Cretan was delated to the senate for various crimes, one of which was, that he had asserted it to be within his own determination, whether or not thanks should be voted to the proconsuls sent to the government of Crete. Thrasea, after giving his opinion on this individual's delinquency, made a speech in which he proposed to check the growing pride of the provincials, and their influence in the senate, by suppressing their expressions of praise to their governors, which was often false, and obtained by improper compliances ; still allowing them the full privilege of accusation when they had been injuriously treated. This proposition was heard with general assent, and a decree of the senate was afterwards made on the subject. But hatred to this excellent man rankled in the breast of the imperial tyrant ; and he gave an open declaration of his displeasure by forbidding him alone, of all the senators, to pay his respects at Antium on the delivery of Poppsea. Being, however, practised in dissimulation, Nero boasted to Seneca that he was reconciled to Thrasea, and was complimented by Seneca on the occasion a presage of approaching danger to both of them ! In the year 66, the 131(1 of Nero, the tyrant, having imbrued his hands in the blood of many of the most illustrious Romans, now resolved, says Tacitus, to extirpate virtue itself by the destruction of Thrasea Psetus and Bareas Soranus. An accusation was therefore brought against Thrasea by Capito Cossutianus, an infamous delator, and his personal enemy, consisting of several facts, the sum of which went to show his contempt of the base adulation of the senate, and his displeasure with the vices and enormities of the reign. From one charge it appears that during the past three years he had not entered the doors of the senate-house. The accuser employed one comparison which conveyed a high eulogy on the culprit, though invidiously applied. "" As formerly (said he) the city in its party dissensions spoke of Cassar and Cato, so now it speaks of Nero and Thrasea."" Tiridatcs King of Armenia, at this time making his entrance into Rome, and Nero returning  from Campania, the city poured forth to meet the two princes. Thrasea received a command not to show himself on this occasion ; but not dispirited by this proof of resentment, he sent a memorial to the emperor, desiring that he might have an opportunity of knowing and refuting the charges against him. Nero ordered the senate to be convoked, when Thrasea consulted his friends whether he ought to attempt a defence before it, or wait at home for his sentence. Different opinions were given, and Thrasea left the determination to his farther reflexions. On the next day the access to the senate-house was beset by two pretorian cohorts under arms. When the court was assembled, the accusers opened their attack, and Cossutianus was followed by Marcellus Eprius, a man of violent and fervid eloquence, who spoke with great acrimony against Thrasea. No defence was made ; apparently, lest by his usual boldness of speaking he might excite the emperor's resentment against his family. It was besides manifest that his fate was decided. The conclusion was, that he and Soranus had the choice of their mode of death granted them. Thrasea was in his gardens surrounded by a number of illustrious persons of both sexes, and attentively listening to Demetrius, a Cynic philosopher, who was discoursing on the nature of the soul, and its separation from the body, when the determination of the senate was announced to him. Thrasea desired the company immediately to retire, lest they should expose themselves to join their fate with his. His wife, who wished to follow her mother's example, and die with her husband, was admonished by him not to rob their daughter of her only support, but to live for her sake. He then went forth into the portico to attend the consul's questor, and gave marks of joy on learning that his son-in-law Helviclius, who had shared in the danger, was only banished from Italy. Receiving the decree of the senate, he took Demetrius and Helvidius with him into his bed-chamber5 and laying bare the veins of both arms, he sprinkled the first blood that flowed, upon the ground, and calling the questor, said, Let us make a libation to Jupiter the Deliverer, Look on, young man ; and may the gods avert the omen ; but you are born at a time in which it is proper to strengthen the mind by examples of fortitude."" He then addressed the philosopher Demetrius; but the manuscript of Tacitus fails us just in the midst of this most interesting scene. Enough, however, has survived to transmit the name of Thrasea among the noblest characters of antiquity. ",Aikin,Taciti Annal. Suetonius. Dio Cass. Plinii Epist. - A.,5852
18,Erectheus,"king of Athens, is reckoned the sixth from Cecrops, and is supposed to have succeeded his father Pandion about 1399 B.C. He was the most powerful Grecian prince of his time. Among his children was a daughter, Orithyia, who is fabled to have been forcibly carried away by the wind Boreas, which is with probability interpreted to refer to her rape by a Thracian king. In his reign the Athenians were instructed by a stranger in the cultivation of corn, whence Ceres is said to have visited Athens at that period. Erectheus, after a reign of fifty years, was slain in a battle against the Eleusians. ",Aikin,Univers. Hist. Moreri. - A.,1924

After various other preferments, ecclesiastical and civil, conferred by the favour of the king, he was made Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1364; soon after Secretary to the King; Chief of the Privy Council, and Governor of the Grand Council. In 1366, he was promoted to the see of Winchester, after which he was constituted Chancellor of England, which last office he was deprived of through court intrigues, at the close of Edwards reign, but was reinstated in it on the accession of Richard. He, however, resigned the great seal in 1391, and died in 1404. In 1373 he began his preparatory school at Winchester, which was to be the nursery for his college; the foundation stone of which latter was laid in 1380, and completed in six years, as was also the school, form the time of its commencement. The design of this establishment, which surpasses all the rest in magnificence, is to provide a perpetual maintenance and instruction for 200 scholars, from the lowest class of grammatical learning, to the highest degree in the several faculties.",Crabb,Hist.

20,"Windichind, or Witikind","a German historian of the tenth century, was a Benedictine monk of the monastery of Corbie, in Saxony.

He wrote a History of the Saxons, in three books, comprehending the actions of the Emperor Otho I. and terminating at his death in 973. It is dedicated to Queen Mathildis, daughter of that emperor, and was first printed at Basil, in 1532. An edition was given by Meibomius, with notes and dissertations, in a collection of historical works, Frankf 1621, reprinted with the ""Scriptores Rerum Germanarum,"" Helmstadt, 1688.

21,Zamolxis,"A celebrated person among the Scythians, is reported to have been the slave of Pythagoras, and to have accompanied his master into Egypt, where he was manumitted, and whence he carried his doctrine to his countrymen, the Getes. It is added, that having disclosed the immortality of the soul to this people, in order to give them evidence of its truth, he dug a subterraneous apartment, in which he concealed himself three years, and then re-appearing as from the dead, fully established his authority as a teacher. Herodotus, however, who relates this story, seems to give it little credit, and professes his belief that Zamolxis lived long before Pythagoras. The truth seems to be, that he was a Thracian, who at a remote period inculcated the doctrine of the immortality of the soul among the Scythians, and was after his death regarded by them as a divinity, with whom they were to dwell in the invisible world. The same historian says, that on certain festal days they chose by lot several persons, who were to be sent as messengers to Zamolxis, and whom they put to death, by throwing them up in the air, and catching them on the points of their spears; a circumstance not improbable among a barbarous people, who are known to have practised human sacrifices.",Aikin,Herodot.

23,Zeno the Eleatic,"a Grecian philosopher, born at Elea, in Magna Graecia, flourished about 463 B.C. He was a disciple of Parmenides, and by some is said to have been his adopted son. Continuing to reside in his native city, which, small as it was, he preferred to Athens, as allowing of more independence, he became a celebrated master in the Eleatic sect. Some have erroneously ascribed to him the invention of the dialectic art; it is however certain that he displayed much subtlety in those logical argumentations, which were afterwards reduced to rule by Aristotle and others. He was a zealous friend of civil liberty, and is supposed to have lost his life in opposing a tyrant. There are so many different narrations of this event, that some have doubted the whole fact, yet it seems verified by the concurrent voice of antiquity. The substance appears to have been, that having been detected in a conspiracy against the petty tyrant of his native place, he endured the most cruel torments without betraying his accomplices; and that at length his countrymen, roused by the example of his fortitude, fell upon the usurper and stoned him to death. According to Aristotle, Zeno taught that nothing can be produced either from that which is similar or dissimilar: that there is only one being, which is God; and that this being is eternal, homogeneous, and spherical: that there are many worlds: that in nature there is no vacuum: that all bodies are composed of four elements, heat, moisture, cold, and dryness: that the body of man is from the earth, and his soul is composed of an equal mixture of the four elements. He employed all his subtlety in arguing against the possibility of motion; and according to the representation of Seneca, he carried his scepticism so far as to deny the real existence of external objects. In reality, he seems, to have accustomed himself so much to reason on both sides of a question, and to have been so destitute of precise and definite notions, that it is impossible to determine what sense he put upon his words, and whether he admitted or rejected a properly divine nature. His practical philosophy is depreciated by Bayle from his justification of the warmth with which he resented reproach: ""If I were indifferent to censure (said he) I should also be indifferent to praise"": yet it is perhaps too much to be expected from a philosopher that he should extinguish all sensibility of the opinion expressed of him by his fellow creatures. His writings appear to have been in great esteem among the ancients, but none of them have reached modern times.",Aikin,Diogea. Laert. Bayle. Brucker. A.,6289

Campano also wrote a treatise on the quadrature of the circle, printed in the appendix to the Margarita Filisofica. He likewise composed several works on astronomy, which are preserved in MS. in various libraries. They treat on the motions of divers planets, on the instruments necessary for observing them, on the ecclesiastical computation, and on the theory of the planets in general. A letter of his to Fra Rainero da Todi, a contemporary astronomer, on the motion of the eighth sphere, is extant in St. Mark's library at Florence.

34,"Michael, Cerularius","patriarch of Constantinople in the eleventh century, was raised to that dignity in the year 1043. ^e was a person of a restless and ambitious spirit; a determined enemy to the church of Rome and the papal claims ; and in the year 1053, the reviver of the famous contest between the Greek and Latin churches, which had been suspended for a considerable time. The pretexts which were employed to justify this new rupture, were zeal for the truth, and an anxious concern about the interests of religion ; but its true causes were the arrogance and ambition of the Grecian patriarch and the Roman pontiff. The latter was constantly forming the most artful stratagems to reduce the former under his yoke ; and, on the other hand, the Grecian pontiff was not only determined to refuse obstinately the least mark of submission to his haughty rival, but was also laying schemes for extending his own dominion, and for reducing all the Oriental patriarchs under his supreme jurisdiction. Among the measures to which they mutually had recoi>>e, in order to sap the foundations of each other's authority and influence with the people, were accusations of holding corrupt doctrines, or heresies, of the most dangerous nature. On the present occasion Cerularius struck the first blow, by a letter written in his own name, and in the name of Leo, bishop of Acrida, in which he publicly accused the Latins of various errors of consequence. Of such a description, among others which are enumerated by ecclesiastical historians, were their fasting on the sabbath, or seventh day of the week ; their permitting the use of milk and cheese in the first week of Lent ; their using unleavened bread in the celebration of the Lord's supper ; their allowing their priests to be beardless , their confining themselves to one single immersion in the rite of baptism, &c. Such trifling objects as thesej in those dark times, were considered to be so serious and import.int, as to excite a fatal schism, and kindle a furious war between the Greeks and Latins, who carried their animo-: ities to the greatest lengths,and loaded each other with reciprocal invectives and imprecations. To the letter of Cerularius pope Leo IX. wrote a most imperious reply; and at the same time assembled a council at Rome, in which the Greek churches were solemnly excommunicated. In our life of that pontiff"", we have mentioned the unsuccessful issue of the effort made by the emperor Constantine Monomachus to stifle this controversy in its birth ; and also the insolent and imprudent proceeding of the papal legates at Constantinople, in publicly excommunicating the patriarch, and all who should continue in his communion. Out of resentment, the patriarch excommunicated these legates with all their adherents -and followers, in a public council, and procured ark order from the emperor for burning the sentence pronounced against the Greeks. These violent measures were followed, on both sides, with a number of controversial writings, which were filled with the most bitter and irritating invectives, that contributed to widen the breach between the Greek and Latin churches^ till it became irreparable. In the year 1057, when the struggle took place between the emperor Stratioticus and Isaac Comnenus for the imperial crown, our patriarch embraced the interests of the latter, and was one of the principal instruments of raising him to that dignity. Owing either to the persuasion or menaces of Cerularius, Stratioticus divested himself of the purple, and retired into a monastery ; after which Comnenus advanced to Constantinople,, where the influence of the patriarch had prepared the way for his being received without opposition, and he was crowned by that prelate on the day after his arrival. In the following year, the emperor being compelled by the exhausted state of the public treasury to lay heavy taxes upon the people, thought it reasonable to draw from the monasteries also part of the immense wealth with which tiny* had been enriched by his predecessors. This, proceeding was highly resented by the patriarch, who arrogantly threatened to pull him down from the throne 10 which he had raised him, unless he restored what he had taken from the religious houses. Exasperated at this insolent menace, the emperor caused Cerularius to be arrested, deposed, and sent into exile, where he died soon afterwards. Two of this patriarch's "" Letters,"" in Greek and Latin,,  may be seen in the second volume of "" Cotelerii Eccl. Grasc. Vjonum.;"" and two of his "" Synodical ] diets,"" together with fragments of others, in Greek and Latin, are preserved in "" Jur. Grsec."" Lib. II!. and IV. and in Leo Allatius "" De Lib. Eccles.

Of his history we have no accounts, nor is it certainly known when he flourished, though it was probably before the time of Galen, since, nmong all the eminent physicians whom he cites, he never mentions him. He wrote in a very harsh, impure Latin style ; and a great part of his works consists in a version of Soranus, though he occasionally interposes his own opinion, and gives some observations from his own practice. His knowledge of Greek was by no means accurate, as appears from his etymological mistakes. No ancient writer on physic is so copious in practical matter ; and, amid the wreck of old authors, he has acquired much incidental value by the numerous passages from them which are preserved in his works. He treats of a greater number of diseases than any other ancient writer extant ; and in citing authorities he does not hesitate freely to expose what appeared to him to be errors.

37,"Peter, surnamed Comestor, or the Eater","another eminent French ecclesiastic in die I2th century, was a native of Troyes in Champagne. Having embraced the clerical profession, he became canon, and afterwards dean, of the cathedral in that city. In this situation he acquired such celebrity, that he was invited to Paris, where he was appointed dean of the metropolitan church. Some time after this he resigned his benefices, renounced the world, nnd entered among the canonsregular of St. Victor at Paris, where he gave himself up wholly to study and exercises of devotion. He died in the year i 198. He was a man of learning for the age in which he lived, and, what reflects credit on his memory, had the hardihood publicly to condemn some of the abuses and corruptions of the Romish church. This we learn from the testimony of Girald Larry, more generally known by the name of Giraldus Cambrensis, who was his disciple, and most probably imbibed from him the enmity which on all occasions he discovered against the monks. In a manuscript of that author preserved in the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth, he tells us that he heard Peter declare before his whole school, in which many persons of distinguished literature were present, that the old enemy, meaning the devil, never insidiously devised a more injurious measure against the church of God, than the law which enjoined a vow of celibacy on the clergy. The following epitaph upon his tomb has been thought not unworthy of preservation, by different authors who have communicated notices of him to the public : Petrus eram, quern Petra tegit, dictusque Coincstor.

64,A. Rashid.,"caliph of the Saracens, was the second son of the caliph Mahadi or Mohdi. In early youth he acquired military renown in the command of an expedition sent by his father against the Greek empress Irene, in which he laid waste several of the Asiatic provinces of the empire, spread an alarm to Constantinople itself, and compelled the empress to purchase peace by a tribute. After the short reign of his elder brother Hadi, he succeeded to the caliphate A.D. 786, being then about twenty-four years of age. He was the most potent and vigorous monarch of his race, and ruled over territories extending from Egypt to Khorasan. The name of al Rasbid, the Righteous, or Just, was conferred upon him as an illustrious example of that virtue; but his justice, like that of most despots, was sullied by occasional acts of violence and caprice. One of his noblest qualities was a love of learning and science, which he patronised with so magnificent a spirit, that his court became the resort of the most eminent literary characters of his time. He caused many Latin and Greek authors to be translated into Arabic, and dispersed copies of their works over his whole empire. He first made the Iliad and Odyssey known to the eastern poets, who, it must be confessed, never imbibed much of the taste of European composition. He was extremely magnificent to his physicians, of whom the most trusted were Christians of the family of Baktishua (see that article). Of the events of this reign, one of the first was an incursion of the king of the Khozars, who committed great ravages before he could be opposed by the caliph's troops, who were employed in an invasion of the empress Irene's dominions, consequent upon her breach of the truce between them. In 792 a rebellion was raised in the province of Deylam by Yahia a descendant of AH, who was declared caliph. Haroun sent his general Al Fadi at the head of an army to suppress it. By an artful negotiation he persuaded Yahia to quit his party and trust himself to the clemency of the caliph, who sent him a promise under his own hand of security for life and liberty. On his first airival at Bagdad he was graciously received; but Haroun's suspicions at length induced him first to imprison, and then to put him to death; an action which greatly sullied his character in the eyes of the most respectable of his subjects. But the men of learning whom he paid, and the devotees whom he conciliated by religious zeal, and particularly by a pilgrimage on foot to Mecca, treated him with their accustomed adulation. His deference, indeed, for the doctors of his religion was very great; and it is recorded that one Malek, the founder of an orthodox Mahometan sect, having been sent for by the caliph in order to instruct his sons, and returning an answer, that ""knowledge would not wait upon any person, but was itself to be waited upon,"" Haroun owned that he was in the right, and directed that his children should attend him at the public school. Haroun is said eight times to have invaded the Greek empire. On the deposition of Irene, and the succession of Nicephorus in 802, the new emperor refused to pay tribute to the caliph, and intimated, by a present of swords delivered with an epistle, that he was ready to trust his cause to the decision of arms. The caliph ordered the swords to be fixed together in the ground, and drawing his scymetar cut them all asunder at a stroke. He then dictated the following characteristic epistle: ""In the name of the most merciful God: Haroun al Rashid, Commander of the Faithful, to Nicephorus the Roman dog: I have read thy letter, O you son of an unbelieving mother! Thou shalt not hear, but shalt behold, my reply."" This menace was made good by an irruption into Greece, the provinces of which were laid waste by the Saracens with sword and fire, while at the same time a fleet disembarked a body of troops on the isle of Cyprus which was treated in a similar manner. In subsequent campaigns, Nicephorus was defeated in person by Haroun, great part of Asia Minor was overrun by the tirms of the Saracens, and Heraclca, a city on the Black Sea, was totally destroyed. The war, after several renewals, was finally terminated by a treaty in which Nicephorus agreed to pay an augmentation of tribute, and not to rebuild Heraclea and the other ruined towns. During the course of these transactions, the ruin of the family of the Barmacides gave a striking example of the despotic rigour which was a part of Haroun's character. Yahia, the head of this family, had superintended the caliph's education, and assisted in his government. Of his four sons, Al Fadl, the eldest, was a successful general; Jaafar (Giaffar), the second, was the caliph's vizir and declared favourite, and distinguished himself by his proficiency in politer literature; Mahomet and Musa, the two youngest, were a!so in dignified stations. They were all educated in opulence, and had imbibed sentiments worthy of their fortune. Their generosity, munificence, and arEibility,rer.dered them the darlings of all ranks of people. Jaafar was so much in his master's good graces, that he could not endure to be without his company; and being equally attached to his own sister Abbasa, he thought fit to break through the eastern formality of excluding unmarried females from the view of the other sex. A mutual passion was the consequence, which the caliph so far indulged as to permit a marriage between his sister and the vizir, but with die cruel restriction of their abstaining from the privileges of such an union. Passion broke through this unjust prohibition (see the article ABBASA); the consequences could not be concealed; and this circumstance is commonly said to have brought down the monarch's vengeance upon the head of Jaafar and his family. Others rather impute the catastrophe to his jealousy of their riches and influence. Whatever were the cause, Jaafar was publicly executed; his venerable father was imprisoned, and either died or was put to death in prison; and the property of the whole race was confiscated. A decree was even made forbidding on pain of death all mention of the names or actions of the Barmacides ; but a grateful old man who ventured openly to disobey it, obtained his pardon and a present from the caliph. Haroun attained the summit of worldly prosperity, and was certainly the richest and most potent sovereign of his time. The French historians mention a splendid embassy which he sent to Charlemagne, which, among other presents, brought a magnificent tent, a waterclock, an elephant, and the keys of the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem, denoting permission for European pilgrims to visit it. In common with the western monarch, he adopted the plan of making a division of his extensive dominions between his three sons a fertile source of future civil wars. Like him, too, he passed a life of great activity, frequently visiting his most distant provinces. His principal residence was a favourite palace at Racca on the Euphrates. After a return from an expedition to quiet some commotions in Persia, he was seized with great dejection of spirits, and an apprehension of soon falling into some mortal distemper. By proper remedies he was almost recovered, when the revolt of a captain named Rafe ebn Leith in the provinces beyond the Oxus, summoned him into the field. He marched at the head of a powerful army, but on his arrival at the frontiers, he found himself too much indisposed to proceed. Retiring to Tous in Khorasan, he sunk into his former state of despondence, and died in October, 808, at the age of forty-seven, after a reign of twenty-three years. His last command was that of cutting in pieces before his face the brother of the rebel against whom he was marching. It can only have been in comparison with other Saracen princes that he is extolled for humanity ; but in alms-giving, in punctilious demotion, in liberality to poets and men of letters, in courage and activity, he has had few superiors among sovereigns. Nor was he incapable of just and generous sentiments when reflection was not impeded by passion. He could occasionally bear bold remonstrances, of which the following story is an instance. In one of his military progresses, a woman came to him with a complaint that some of his soldiers had pillaged her house. ""Hast thou not read,"" said Haroun, ""in the Koran, that where princes pass with their armies they make places desolate ?"" ""True,"" replied the woman; ""but I have also read in the same Koran, that the houses of those princes shall be made desolate for their injustice."" Haroun was struck with the answer, and ordered full restitution to be made to the petitioner. The popular fame of this great caliph is evinced by the Arabian Nights Entertuinments, in which Haroun, with his queen Zobeide, his vizir Giafar, and his chief eunuch Mesrour, are the actors in a great number of the tales.

112,"Lupus, Servatus","a French abbot in the ninth century, celebrated for his learning, eloquence, and piety, was descended from a considerable family in the diocese of Sens, and born about the commencement of the century. After having received a learned education, he embraced the ecclesiastical life in the abbey of Ferrieres, under Alaric ur Aldric, who was then abbot, and afterwards archbishop of Sens. About the year 828 he went from this monastery to the abbey of Fulda, in Germany, where he studied the Scriptures under the celebrated Rabanus, who at his request composed his ""Commentaries upon the Epistles of St. Paul."" Lupus, who was yet only a deacon, ably profited by the instructions of this learned man, and returned to France in the year 836, with a high reputation for his proficiency in scriptural knowledge. Soon afterwards he was introduced to the empress Judith, who presented him to the emperor Lewis the Debonfiaire, at whose court he continued for some time, in the expectation of preferment. In the year 842, he was fixed upon by Charles the Bald to supersede Odo in the abbacy of Ferrieres, whom that prince was determined to deprive of his monastery, on account of his having embraced the party of Lotharius. Odo, however, resisted his taking possession, till compelled by imperial power to quit the field. In the year 844, Lupus assisted at the council of Verneuil, and was selected to draw up the canons of the council. He also assisted at other assemblies of the French bishops, particularly at the council of Soissons, in 853. Some time before the year 855, he was sent ambassador from Charles the Bald to pope Leo IV.; and that prince afterwards gave him a commission, jointly with the celebrated Prudentius, to reform all the monasteries in France. These two illustrious characters were zealous defenders of St. Augustine's doctrine of grace. The time of his death is uncertain; but he was living at the close of the year 861, and maintained a high reputation, not only for his extensive acquaintance with profane and general literature, but for his knowledge of the doctrine and discipline of the church, of the writings of the Latin fathers, and his extraordinary sanctity of manners. A collection has been made of 130 of his ""Letters,"" upon different subjects, relating to difficulties in grammar, civil and ecclesiastical affairs, points of doctrine, discipline and morals; which are written with solidity, correctness, and elegance, and throw considerable light on the history of the period in which he lived. They were first published by Papirius Masson in 1588, in an octavo volume, and afterwards, in a much more correct state, by Andrew du Chesne, in the third volume of his ""Collection of French Historians."" There are also still extant, by Lupus, ""A Book of the three Questions,"" relating to free will, predestination, and the redemption by the blood of Christ, written against Godeschalc; two ""Letters,"" one to Charles the Bald, and another to Hincmar, bishop of Rheims, first published by father Sirmond in 1648; ""The Life of St. Wigbert, Abbot of Fritzlar;"" and ""The Life of St. Maximin, Bishop of Treves,"" published by Busaeus, in 1602.

He established his medical practice in Edinburgh, where he became a Fellow and later the president of the College of Physicians. In 1746, he was elected to the chair of the institutions of medicine at the university. He gained fame both as a private practitioner and as a medical educator and published several ingenious works. His first work was an ""Essay on the Vital and other Involuntary Motions of Animals"" in 1751. His theory differed from Stahl's, attributing these motions not to the soul acting toward a predetermined end but to the power of stimulus. In 1755, he published ""Physiological Essays, containing an Inquiry into the Causes which promote the Circulation of the Fluids in the very small Vessels of Animals; with Observations on the Sensibility and Irritability of the Parts of Man and other Animals."" In this work, he proposed that the action of the heart alone isn't sufficient to propel blood through the tiniest vessels and that it's assisted by an oscillatory motion of the vessels themselves. He also challenged some of Haller's conclusions regarding sensibility and irritability. An expanded edition of this work was published in 1761. Dr. Whytt also published ""An Essay on the Virtues of Lime-water in the Cure of the Stone"" in 1752, ""Observations on the Nature, Cause, and Cure of those Disorders which are commonly called Nervous, Hypochondriac, and Hysteric"" in 1764, and contributed papers to the Edinburgh ""Essays and Observations, Physiological and Literary."" After his death, ""Observations on the Dropsy of the Brain"" was published. All of his practical works contain precise descriptions and judicious remarks. He suffered from chronic illnesses for a long time and passed away in 1766. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and the first physician to the King in Scotland. An edition of all his works was published by his son in 1768 in 4to, under the supervision of Sir John Pringle, who is credited with softening some of the harsh expressions used in the controversy between Whytt and Haller.

240,Rupert,"a learned and pious Benedictine abbot in the twelfth century, was a native of Flanders, and born in the territory of Ypres, in the year 1091. He embraced the monastic life at a very early age, in the abbey of St. Lawrence, near Liege, where his application to his studies was incessant, till he had made an extraordinary progress in all the literature of the times, and had acquired a knowledge of the Scriptures superior to that of most of his contemporaries. By his unrivalled merit in that community he secured the distinguished favour of the Abbot Berenger ; but at the same time provoked the envy and ill offices of the indolent and ignorant monks. On this account Berenger, when he was sensible that he was near his end, recommended Rupert to the protection of Cuno, Abbot of Siegberg in Westphalia. Under his patronage, delivered, as we are informed by himself, from the persecutions of false brethren, our learned monk began to communicate to the world his commentaries on the sacred Scriptures, in the year 1117. By these and other productions of his pen, his reputation was raised so high, that Frederic Archbishop of Cologne, took him from the cloister, and made him abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Duyts, on the banks of the Rhine opposite to that city. Here he died in the year 1135, about the age of forty-four. He was one of the principal persons who contributed to introduce a new mode of commenting upon the Scriptures in this century. For, instead of following the example of the ancient fathers, who were accustomed to explain the text either literally or allegorically, or imitating the ecclesiastical authors between the eighth century and his own time, whose works of this kind consisted only of Catena's, or continued collections of explications and glosses from the writings of different fathers ; he endeavoured to illustrate the Scriptures chiefly by'the use of dialectics, discussing a variety of subtle questions relating to doctrinal points, and producing a great number of common places. It is also deserving of notice, that his opinion relating to the eucharist differed widely from the Catholic doctrine of more modern times, since he held, that though the real body and blood of Christ were present in that sacrament, yet the real substance of the bread and wine also remained in it. His works consist of "" Commentariorum de sanctissima Trinitate et operibus ejus, Lib. XLII."" including his illustration of the Pentateuch, the books of Joshua, Judges, parts of the books of Kings and the Psalms, the prophesies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Malachy, the books of the Macchabees, some parts of the four gospels, and other selected passages of Scripture; ""Comment, in Cantica Canticorum, Lib. VII.;"" ""Comment, in Job,""taken from the works of Gregory the Great;"" ""Comment, in Ecclesiasten, Lib. V.;"" ""De Gloria et Honore Filii Hominis super Mattlweum, Lib.

Several of these works were published in separate forms; and the whole of them were collected together, and printed at Cologne, in 1553, at Antwerp, in 1565, 1577, 1598, and 1602, and lastly at Paris, in 1638, in 2 vols. folio.

241,Ruysbroeck,"a famous Flemish mystical writer in the 14th century, was bom at the village whence he took his surname, situated between Brussels and Hall, in the year 1293. He was placed for education under the instructions of a canon to whom he was related ; but at the age of fifteen, when he had made but a small progress in grammar-learning, he renounced the study of all human wisdom, for that of spiritual knowledge, and for divine contemplation. Having been admitted to priest's orders, he became at first curate and next rector of the church of St. Gedula at Brussels. Afterwards he retired into the forest of Soignies, and at Groendal, two leagues from Brussels, founded a monastery for canons-regular of the order of St. Augustine, in which he filled the post of prior. The last office which he held was that of reformer of the order throughout the Low-Countries. Before he quitted Brussels he had published seme pieces in mystical divinity, which were much esteemed by persons of the same spiritual taste ; but those of his writings which they considered to abound in the most sublime thoughts, which, as they tell us, "" ravished to admiration, and even almost to extacy, the most excellent professors in divinity, who owned that they could not comprehend them,"" appear to have been produced at Groendal. Of his fanatical turn of mind we may form some idea, from the answer which he gave to Gerard Magnus, who excepted against some singular notions and expressions in his books. "" Be perfectly assured,"" said he, "" that I never inserted a single word in my writings without being inspired by the Holy Ghost; and in a certain singular and most delightful presence of the most Holy Trinity."" It is said, that when he was about to compose any work, he was accustomed to retire alone into the most unfrequented part of the forest, where he waited in the deepest silence expecting inspiration from above ; and that whenever he imagined communications were made to him, he wrote them down, to serve as materials for the works which he drew up and digested after his return to his monastery. He died in the year 1381, at the great age of eighty-eight. His works were orignally written in the Flemish language, and were some of them translated into Latin by William Jordan, a contemporary and of the same order with the author. Afterwards the whole of them were translated into that language, by Laurence Surius. They consist of "" Regnum Amantium Deum, sive Summa Vitas Spirituals ;"" "" De Nuptiis spiritunlibus, Lib. III. ;"" "" De Calculo, sive de Perfectione Filiorum Dei ;"" "" De Quatuor Tentationibus ;"" "" De Fide et Judicio;"" "" De VII. Seris sive Custodiis ;"" "" Liber Apologeticus, sive Retractationis, de Unione amantis Animae cum Deo;"" "" De Tabernaculo spiritual! Moysis ;"" "" Speculum Salutis seternse,"" &c.

Under this master, he assiduously studied the several branches of science, as far as they were then known, particularly theological and biblical literature, and he acquired great reputation by his proficiency, as well as the friendship of the most eminent men in that seat of learning. According to Cave, his fame as a writer commenced about the year 1150. In 1164, he was elected prior of his monastery; where he died in the year 1173, equally respected for his virtues as for his learned attainments. Concerning his merits as a writer, Dupin observes that ""he shows a great deal of subtlety in his theological treatises and argues methodically, with an exactness becoming an able logician. His critical pieces are very accurate, for the time in which he lived. His style, however, is not very elevated; on which account his pious treatises, though abounding in excellent matter, are greatly deficient in weight and energy."" His works consist of critical observations and remarks on some of the historical parts of the Old Testament, relating to the tabernacle and the temple of Solomon; allegorical and moral Commentaries on several of the Psalms, the Song of Songs, and the Apocalypse; questions on certain difficult passages of St. Paul's epistles, and other parts of the Bible, part of which is printed among the works of Hugh of St. Victor; and numerous critical, doctrinal, and practical treatises, which are particularized in the two first of our authorities.

289,Ricimer,"Count and Patrician of the Western Empire, and an important civil and military character in the 5th century, was the son of Wallia, daughter of the King of the Visigoths, by a father of Suevian origin. From his youth, he served in the Roman armies, where he acquired great reputation through his warlike exploits, and came to be regarded as the ablest commander of the age. Sidonius Apollinaris accumulates in his character of Ricimer all the excellencies of the most celebrated names in ancient Rome; however, it appears from his actions that they had the alloy of perfidy and unprincipled ambition. In the reign of the Emperor Avitus, being one of the chief commanders of the Barbarian troops that formed the defense of Italy, he destroyed, in the year 456, on the coast of Corsica, a fleet of Genseric the Vandal King, destined to ravage the coasts of Gaul or Italy. This success enabled him to avail himself of the public discontents to depose Avitus and raise Majorian to the throne in 457. The vigor and ability with which this prince maintained his dignity disappointed Ricimer's expectations of enjoying the supreme authority under his name. Ricimer fomented a sedition among the troops at Tortona, where Majorian was encamped on his return from Gaul, and compelled him, in 461, to abdicate the purple, an act soon followed by his death. Ricimer then elevated to the throne one Libius Severus, an obscure man who bore the title of Emperor for four years without performing any imperial function. In that period, and in an interregnum of two years more, Ricimer exercised sovereign authority, amassing treasures, forming a separate army, and negotiating alliances. He cut off a king of the Alans, with all his followers, who had invaded Italy, but he was unable to extend his sway beyond the Alps, where two generals, Egidius in Gaul, and Marcellinus in Dalmatia, maintained themselves in independence. The Barbarian birth of Ricimer prevented his assumption of the purple, and in 467, he concurred in the inauguration of Anthemius, whose daughter he married at the same time. The new Emperor and his potent son-in-law passed some years in union, but eventually, dissensions broke out between them, and Ricimer, withdrawing from Rome, fixed his residence at Milan. There, after a feigned reconciliation with Anthemius, he incited his army to revolt, and with a reinforcement of new Barbarian levies, marched to Rome. After a vigorous resistance, the unfortunate capital was stormed and sacked with every circumstance of cruelty in July 472, and Anthemius, dragged from his concealment, was murdered by order of Ricimer, who caused Olybrius to be proclaimed in his stead. He himself was shortly after carried off by disease, bequeathing the command of his army to his nephew Gundebald, a Burgundian prince.",Aikin,Univers. Hist. Gibbon. A.,"Aikin_I-Z, ln 8946"

293,Rotharis,"King and legislator of the Lombards, was Duke of Brescia at the time of the death of King Ariovald in 638, who left a widow named Gundeberg, and no male issue. The Lombard nobles gave Gundeberg the privilege of raising to the throne the person she should choose for a husband, and her choice fell upon Rotharis. He repudiated his wife for the sake of his royal spouse, whom he promised to maintain in the dignity of queen. He was, however, an Arian and she a Catholic; and either in consequence of that diirerence, or some other cause of dissention, he violated his obligation, and shut her up in an apartment of the palace of Pavia, till, after a confinement of five years, she was restored to her rank through the mediation of Clovis II. Rotharis, soon after his election, had to contend against the opposition of some disaffected nobles, which he quelled with great severity, and afterwards reigned with equal glory and prosperity at home and abroad. Not conceiving himself bound by the treaty his predecessor had made with the exarch of the empire, he suddenly broke into the province of the Cottian Alps, which he reduced, and then made himself master of all the towns in the Venetian province. The exarch in the meantime made an incursion into the Lombard territory, which called away Rotharis from his conquests; and an engagement ensued, in which the exarch was totally defeated, and obliged to save the relics of his army by flight. Rotharis likewise penetrated into Liguria, and took Genoa, Albenga, and other maritime towns, which he pillaged and dismantled, carrying away the inhabitants as prisoners. It was much more to his praise that he was the first who gave to his nation a code of written laws. In the fifth year of his reign he summoned a general diet of his nobles at Pavia, where, with their consent, he enacted a number of laws, which were made public in an edict issued in 643, consisting of 386 articles. Although many of these have the stamp of a rude age and people, yet they are accounted more judicious than the laws of some other barbaric people; and it is observable that Rotharis was sufficiently enlightened to deride the superstition of witchcraft, and protect the victims of that imputed crime from popular rage. He also practised religious toleration, and provided in all the cities of his kingdom a bishop for each of the two persuasions, the Arian and the Catholic. After having filled the Lombard throne for 15 years and 4 months, with the character of the most illustrious prince of his time, he died in 653, at the age of 47.

300,Sigebertus,"One of the most learned and diligent writers of his time, appears to have been a native of Brabant, and in his younger years embraced the monastic state in the abbey of Gemblours, under the Abbot Olbertus, who died in 1048. During his noviciate he was invited to Metz, where he studied in the school of the monastery of St. Vincent, which was then superintended by the Abbot Folcuinus, who had been his school fellow at Gemblours. Calmet places the arrival of Sigebert at Metz about, the year 980, which does not agree with the other dates; and this is the more surprizing, as the catalogue of the abbots of the abbey of St. Vincent in that author places the Abbot Folcuinus about the year 1050. But whoever young Sigebert may have been, he acquired great consideration by his learning, in which he was superior to most of the other writers who flourished at the same period. He was acquainted with the Greek and the Hebrew, and in consequence of the progress he had made in the latter, was much esteemed by the Jews at Metz, where he resided several years, and from which he was  with difficulty suffered to depart in order to return to his former monastery. His celebrity accompanied him thither; he gained many scholars who did honour to their instructor, and he was chosen by the clergy of Liege to manage their defence in a controversy they had with the Pope, which he conducted with great ability and moderation. In the account which he gives in his chronicle of this dispute, he has attended to the duty of an historian, and written with a candour and in a manner which evidently shew that he did not suffer his pen to be guided by the blind impulse of passion. He attained to a great age, and died in 1112. Sigebert was a fertile writer, and composed many works, of which he has himself given a catalogue. They are chiefly biographical and historical; and a list of such as have been preserved and are printed either separately or in different collections, may be found in the work which is the authority for this article.

306,Speusippus,"An Athenian philosopher, son of Eurymedon by a sister of Plato, succeeded his uncle in his school, over which he presided during eight years, commencing from the death of that celebrated teacher, B.C. 348. He placed the statues of the Graces in the school built by Plato in the academy, and closely adhered to the doctrines of his master. His manners, however, were not conformable to his philosophy, for he was passionate and a lover of pleasure, of which last propensity he gave proof by paying a visit to the court of Cassander in Macedonia at the splendid nuptials of that prince. He was also avaricious; and, contrary to the practice of Plato, exacted a gratuity from his disciples. Through the introduction of Plato, he was admitted to an intimate friendship with Dion while he resided at Athens, and it was by his instigation that Dion, invited by the malcontents of Syracuse, undertook his expedition against Dionysius. Becoming paralytic in his limbs, he was conveyed to and from the academy on a vehicle. On one of these occasions, he met Diogenes and saluted him; but the cynic, instead of returning his civility, upbraided him for bearing to live under such an infirmity. Speusippus well replied, ""that he lived not in his limbs, but in his mind."" At length, however, according to Laertius, being overcome by age and malady, he put an end to his existence, having first constituted Xenocrates his successor in the academy.
