Canada,Canada,"John Verrazen took possession of Canada, in the name of the king of France, in 1525. The French attempted to settle it in 1534, and in 1608 Mr. Champlain built Quebec; but the whole country was conquered by the English in 1759, and  it was confirmed to them by the peace in 1763. AFTER this chart was drawn, and sent to the Engraver, another was published, under the Title of “ARTIFICIAL MEMORY,” by Mess. Balfour and Bell, on which I have just time to make the following cursory remarks. These gentlemen have remedied the inconvenience of using different scales, or measures of time, which was, undoubtedly, a great objection to the French Chart; but in order to do this, they have drawn out their Chart to the inconvenient length of more than five feet. They have also been more careful to make their lines correspond to the dates, in which the other Chart is most shamefully inaccurate; but in every other respect I cannot help thinking it much inferior to the French Chart.",1.01
Nova Scotia,Nova Scotia,"Sir William Alexander settled in Nova Scotia in 1622, but  it was surrendered to the French by Charles I, on the family alliance between him and that court in 1632. It was recovered by major Sedwick under Cromwell, in 1654, delivered again to the French by Charles II, in 1662, recovered by Sir William Phipps in 1690, ceded to France at the peace of Riswick in 1697, but conquered again by the English in 1710, and confirmed to them by the treaty of Utrecht in 1714. Afterwards, in conjunction with the Indians, the French gave great disturbance to the English settlers in this country, but their possession was again confirmed by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748.",1.02
New England and New York,New England and New York,"New England was first settled in 1614 by the Plymouth company, who left the crew of a single ship on the coast to trade. In 1620 some Dissenters, being persecuted at home, fled to this country, and having purchased the Plymouth patent, built New Plymouth. In 1628 they built Salem, and in 1630 they built Boston, which is now the chief town in the province.

Part of New York was settled by the Dutch in 1608. Soon after the Swedes arrived, and took possession of another part; but they were all dispossessed by the English in 1664.",1.03

Brasil,Brasil,"Brasil was discovered by the Portuguese in 1500, and planted by them in 1549. In 1623 the Portuguese, being under the dominion of Spain, the Dutch possessed themselves of the northern provinces, but they were expelled in the year 1664.",1.12
Morocco,"Mauretania, or Morocco","The first inhabitants of this country are supposed to have been descended from Phut, but colonies of Phoenicians were soon after intermixed with them. This, and all the northern coast of Africa, was conquered by Sesac, king of Egypt, in the life-time of his father Ammon, about 1008 B.C. but he did not retain the conquest. Mauretania was disposed of by the Romans from the time of Augustus, about 25 B.C. but was not made a Roman province till under Claudius, about 50 after Christ. After this it underwent the revolutions of Tunis, till the establishment of the Almoravides; and Yusef, the second emperor of this race, built Morocco, the capital of the empire. About 1116, a period was put to the empire of the Almoravides by Abdalla, a famous preacher in a tribe settled near mount Atlas, and who founded the empire of the Almohedes, which terminated in 1212, their last king being totally defeated in Spain. Upon this event the provinces of the empire revolted, and particularly Tremecen and Fez became separate and independent kingdoms. Morocco was seized by the kings of Fez, but about 1516 this kingdom was seized by the sons of Haschen, who pretended to be of the race of the Shariffs, or the descendants of Mohammed. About 1550 the princes of this race took Fez and Tremecen, which continue parts of the empire of Morocco to this day.",2.01
Tremecen,Tremecen,"This country underwent all the revolutions of Algiers, till after the conquest of all this part of Africa by the Saracens, when the inhabitants shook off the yoke, and formed a new government, which grew very considerable for its riches, and the splendor of its kings; but it was greatly reduced by the Almoravides, and finally conquered by Yusef king of Morocco in 1100. A period being put to the empire of the Almoravides about 1116, it again became independent, but was again reduced by the emperor of Morocco about 1172; but on the decline of the Almohedes in 1212, Ghamrazen recovered the kingdom out of their hands, and tho’ it was besieged and taken by Abul Hassan, the fourth king of Fez, the crown continued in the same family about 120 years, without any considerable alteration, except that the kings of Fez became for a time tributary to Abu Ferez king of Tunis, and his son. At length, the last king being slain by Barbarossa the Turkish pirate, about 1516, this state was united to Algiers.",2.02
Algiers,Algiers,"This territory was, in a great measure, the antient kingdom of Numidia, in which some colonies of Phoenicians settled, about 300 B.C. It was reduced to a Roman province by Julius Caesar, about 44 B.C. and underwent the revolutions mentioned in the preceding article, till about 1206; in the decline of the power of the Almohedes, this country, probably, became independent, at the same time with Fez and Tremecen, Tunis, and Tripoli. Being alarmed with an invasion of the Spaniards in 1516, the people of Algiers invited the Turkish pirate Barbarossa to assist them, but he seized the government himself, and they have since been in some kind of dependence on the Turks, at least under their protection.",2.03
Tunis,Tunis,"This city stands not far from the place where stood antient Carthage, a city built by Dido, who brought a colony of Tyrians hither in 883 B.C. The Carthaginian republick soon grew formidable to all its neighbours, and extended its commerce and empire; till, clashing with the Romans, it was entirely destroyed by them at the conclusion of the third Punic war in 148 B.C. It continued a part of the Roman empire till 439, when it was taken by Genseric the Vandal, whose posterity possessed it till 534, when it was recovered by Belisarius. In 644 the Saracens conquered this, together with the rest of the African coast; and in 910 Obeidallah Al Mohdi drove out the reigning family, called the Aglabites, and founded the Fatemite dynasty, residing at Cairwan in this district. In 952 Al Moez removed the seat of empire from Cairwan into Egypt; but in 1051 the Africans revolted from the Arabs, under the conduct of Techesien of the Zenhagian tribe, bringing an army from the southern provinces of Numidia and Lybia, on which account they were surnamed Morabites, or Almoravides. The emperor of this family resided at Morocco, and Tunis continued subject to him, till the dissolution of the dynasty of the Almoravides by the Almohedes, in about 1116, when it became independent, but was reduced by the emperor of Morocco in 1172. About 1206 Abu Ferez,  governor of Tunis and Tripoli, revolted from the emperor of Morocco. This kingdom, however, was reduced by Selim II, emperor of the Turks, in 1574; but in 1590 the inhabitants got leave to elect their own bey, or governor, as was done at Algiers, but they still, in some measure, acknowledge the supremacy of the court of Constantinople.",2.04
Tripoli,Tripoli,"This territory, which was antiently called Lybia Tripolitana, underwent the revolutions of Tunis, which are recited below, having been conquered by the Carthaginians long before their wars with the Romans. In 1551 it was conquered by Dragut the famous Turkish pirate, in the reign of Solyman I. Some time after, perhaps about 1600, the Tripolitans became independent of the Turks, in the same manner as the people of Algiers and Tunis.",2.05
Egypt (lower Nile),Egypt,"This is one of the oldest kingdoms in the world, and here the children of Israel were held in slavery from the death of Joseph in 1635 B.C. to 1491B.C. In 1445 Lower Egypt was conquered by the Canaanites, who fled from Joshua, when he dispossessed them of their own country. Upper Egypt was divided at this time into a great number of kingdoms, which were united under Misphragmuthosis, about 1157, and the Canaanites, or shepherd kings, as they are called, were driven out of Egypt by Amosis in 1070. About 1000 Sesac, or Sesostris, king of Egypt, made rapid and extensive conquests, carrying his arms as far as Spain, but he did not keep possession of any of the conquered countries. In 974 he, in the like manner, took and plundered Palestine, Syria, and Persia. In 947 the Ethiopians conquered Egypt; in 944 they retired to Memphis, being driven thither by Osarsiphus, who was made king of Lower Egypt; but in 930 the Ethiopians again conquered the whole. In 788 Egypt was divided into several small kingdoms, and in 751 Sabacon the Ethiopian conquered it. In 671 it was subdued by Asserhaddon king of Assyria, but in 668 it revolted from the Assyrians. In 655 Psammeticus became king of all Egypt, by the reduction of eleven other princes, who had reigned along with him. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon conquered this country in 566, but towards the end of this monarchy the Egyptians recovered their liberty. They seem to have been subject to Cyrus about 534, but, probably rebelling, were reduced by Cambyses in 525; and though Egypt several times revolted, it was always recovered by the Persians, and was part of that empire when Alexander the Great put an end to it in 331 B.C. In 30 B.C. it was reduced to a Roman province, and continued a part of the Roman empire, till it was conquered by the Saracens in 640. In 868 Al Tolun, the son of Ahmed, a Turkish slave, being entrusted by the caliph of Bagdat with the government of Egypt and Syria, set up for himself, and maintained his authority not with standing all attempts to depose him; but in 904, Mahomet, general of the caliph Al Moctafi, recovered Egypt to the caliphat, the last caliph of Egypt having assassinated his predecessor, and thereby rendered himself very odious. However, in the year 933, Mahomet, the son of Tagii, surnamed Al Ashked, seized upon Syria and Egypt, in the caliphat of Al Radi, and his family retained the whole of it, except a small part of which Obeidallah Al Mohdi, the first of the Fatemite dynasty (the seat of whose empire was at Cairwan near Tunis) had conquered in 910. His successor Abu Temin Mahud, surnamed Moez Ledinillah, conquered the rest of Egypt about 970, by his general Jaawar, who built the city Al Kahirah, commonly called Grand Cairo, whither his master soon removed his court. The Fatemite dynasty expired in 1176, when, upon the death of the last prince of this family, the kingdom was usurped by the famous Saladin, who had been his vizir, and who began the dynasty of the Ajubites. In 1245 the Mamluks, who were Tartar soldiers employed by the princes of this family, seized the kingdom, and held it till they were conquered by Selim I, emperor of the Turks, in 1517.",2.06

Ethiopia and Abyssinia,Ethiopia and Abyssinia,"This country was ravaged by Sesac, or Sesostris the Egyptian, in the reign of his father Ammon, about 1008 B.C. but upon his death, in 956, the Ethiopians recovered their independency, and in 947 they invaded Egypt, and drowned Orus in the Nile, which put an end to what is called the reign of the gods in Egypt; but in 946 Zerah the Ethiopian was overthrown by Asa king of Judah; and the Egyptians, with the assistance of the Jews and Phoenicians, made Osarsiphus king, expelling the Ethiopians from Lower Egypt. In 671 Ethiopia was conquered by Asserhaddon king of Assyria, but it revolted upon his death in 668. Cyrus seems to have been master of a great part of Ethiopia about 534, but the Ethiopians must have recovered their independency at the time of his death, since Cambyses made a fruitless expedition against them in 525. Ptolemy Euergetes penetrated into Ethiopia about 246 B.C. but he abandoned his conquests; also Aelius Gallus the Roman general made an irruption into this country against queen Candace, but it had no consequence of importance. From this time the history of this country is very little known, but in 960 Fredda Gabey, a wicked woman, killed Del Noad the reigning prince, and set one of her own sons on the throne, whereby an end was put to what is called the Solomonic race, pretended to be descended from king Solomon and the queen of Sheba (which they say was Ethiopia) but this Zygaean family were driven from the throne by Icon Amlac, in whom the Solomonic race was restored, in 1300. This kingdom continues to this day, but we know nothing of its history, except for a short time, when the Jesuits made an attempt to bring the Abyssinians over to popery. Nubia, which was part of antient Ethiopia, is now distinct from Abyssinia.",2.08
Japan,Japan,"Sin-onu, an ecclesiastic, is said to have founded the Japanese monarchy, about 660 B.C. but in 1188 Jerotimo put an end to the supreme ecclesiastic authority, and became the first secular monarch of Japan. In 1598 the Laqueio islands were conquered by the Japanese.",3.01

In 1396 he invaded the rest of India, and in 1399 he entered Delhi the capital of it, conquering the remains of Mahmud Gazni’s empire. From the conquests of Timur Bek to 1526, the Indians seemed to have acknowledged some dependence on the eldest branch of his family, reigning in Buccharia; but notwithstanding this, when Sultan Babr was expelled from Buccharia by the Usbeks, he was obliged to fight his way into India, where he firmly established himself in 1530, and conquered the whole of it, except Decan, Guzerat, and Bengal. In 1538 Bengal was conquered by the Great Moguls (as the reigning princes of this family were then called) and about 1558 Guzerat was conquered by Akbar, who also conquered Candahar, which had become independent. In 1621 Shah Abbas of Persia conquered Candahar. In 1687 Golkonda and Visapour were conquered by the Moguls. The latter of these states was founded by Adel Shah, of the Patan race, in 1530. Nadir Shah of Persia ravaged Indostan in 1738; and kept Gazna, Candahar, and some other places in that neighbourhood.",5.05
Turkestan,Turkestan,"This country was inhabited by the Turks from the earliest antiquity. In 894 it was over-run by Ismael Al Sammani. How long the conquest was retained is not certain, but we find the khans of Turkestan making some figure in 1141, when they were conquered by Gurkhan, prince of the Karakitayn Turks, who came from the borders of China. In 1216 Turkestan was conquered by Jenghis Khan, and afterwards underwent, for the most part, the revolutions of Karasm.",4.02
Karasm,Karasm,"We know nothing certain of this country till it was seized by the Turks, when they over-run Persia in 654. In 680 they were expelled by the Saracens, but in 864 Ismael Al Sammani shook off their yoke, and assumed the title of king of Mawarahlnar and Chorasan. In 1016 this country was conquered by Mahmud Gazni, and in 1043 by the Seljuks; but upon the death of Malek Shah, surnamed Jaladoddin, the third sultan of the Seljuks, in 1092, Kothboddin, then governor of this province, set up for himself, and in 1193 the Seljuks were finally expelled by Takash, the sixth from Kothboddin. In 1218 Jenghis Khan entered Karasm, and completed the conquest of it in 1220. About 1348 it set up its own king, but in 1378 it was conquered by Timur Bek. It submitted to Ilbars Khan of the Usbeks in 1505, and though it was conquered by the Persians, it was recovered by the Usbeks in 1512. It was also seized by Abdollah, khan of Great Buccharia, in 1591, but was recovered again in 1597. These Usbeks were Tartars who came from the borders of Russia, where they were governed by a race of princes descended from Sheibani, the grandson of Jenghis Khan; but they derived their name from Usbek, the seventh of this race, who introduced the Mohammedan religion among them. The last prince of this tribe was Burgo Khan, who was slain by Shah Bakht, upon which the Usbeks quitted their antient habitation, and conquered this country.",4.03
Great Buccharia or Mawarahlnar,Great Buccharia or Mawarahlnar,"This province was the ancient Aria, inhabited by the Nicaei, Astaveni, and other nations. It was probably subject to the Medes, and with them underwent the same revolutions as Persia. In 894 this was part of the empire of Ismael Sammani, but it was conquered by Mahmud Gazni about 995. In 1038 the Seljuks conquered it, but they were expelled by the sultans of Karasm in 1157. It submitted to Jenghis Khan in 1220, and about 1378 it was conquered by Timur Bek; but, upon the death of Shah Ruk, it was seized by Allodawlet his grandson. In 1505 this country was seized by the Usbeks, but the greatest part of it was conquered by the Persians about 1510.  Great Buccharia, or  Mawarahlnar. This country was, perhaps, the antient Bactria, which was a province of the Median, Persian, and Macedonian empires, till Antiochus Theos being engaged in a war with Egypt, it revolted at the same time with Parthia, and Theodotus the governor became king of it, about 250 B.C. Under his descendants it continued during five reigns, i.e. till about 150 B.C. In 655 it was seized by the Turks, but in 707 they were expelled by the Arabs, under Walid. In 894 Ismael Al Sammani revolted from the Arabs, and in 1078 Malek Shah the Seljuk conquered it. In 1124 Gurkhan, being driven out of the Kitah by the Kin, founded a powerful state here; but about 1200 it was conquered by Kothboddin Mohammed, prince of Karasm. The Karasmians were conquered in 1220 by Jenghis Khan, who gave this country to his son Jagatai. In 1369 Timur Bek was crowned prince of this country at Balch, and in 1402 died Mahmud the last prince of the race of the Khans, after several of them had been deprived of all power by Timur Bek, whose descendants formed a new dynasty; but in 1489, Sultan Babr was expelled by the Usbeks under Shah Bakht.",4.04

Candahar,Persia,"It appears from the book of Genesis, that Chederlaomer king of Elam, or Persia, was a powerful prince in the time of Abraham. It made part of the Assyrian empire, but how long is uncertain. In 596 B.C. it was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Afterwards we find it a province to Media; but in 536, Cyrus being king of Persia, gained the ascendency over the Medes, and established a great empire, which continued till 332, when it was overthrown by Alexander the Great. In 250 the Persians, under Arsaces, revolted from Antiochus Theus, one of the Seleucidae, successors to Alexander the Great, and founded a new empire, under the name of the Parthian; but in 229 after Christ, Artaxerxes made a revolution in the empire, and it became Persian again. The Parthians, or Persians, had frequent wars with the Romans; but neither of them gained any permanent advantage over the other, and in 651 an end was put to this empire by the Saracens. In 1037 the Seljukian Turks made considerable conquests in Persia, under Togrul Beg, the grandson of Seljuk, who settled as a private person near Samarkand and Bocchara, and by degrees acquired large possessions. The Seljukians established two dynasties in this country. The more considerable of the two was that of the Seljuks of Iran, or Persiaat large, which began with Togrul Beg in 1037, and ended in 1193, when Togrul II. was defeated and slain by Takash VI, king of Karasm. The Seljuks of Kerman, which is the other dynasty, began in 1041, when Togrul Beg made Kaderd his nephew governor of this country, where he presently became independent. Mahomed Shah, the last prince of this dynasty, was defeated by Malek Dinar, a descendant of Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed, in 1187; and this country, after undergoing some uncertain revolutions, was conquered by the prince of Karasm in 1193. In 1218 all Persia was conquered by Jenghis Khan the Tartar, who defeated Kothboddin Mohammed, the last Karasmian prince. Hulaku, the grandson of Jenghis Khan, put an end to the caliphat at Bagdat in 1258, after the caliphs had long possessed nothing more than an ecclesiastical authority over the Mohammedans. Persia continued subject to the descendants of Jenghis Khan, but divided into many small principalities, and in great confusion after the death of Abusaid in 1335; till it was invaded by Timur Beg the Tartar in 1383, and conquered in 1392. His successors, in a right line, continued in possession of Persia till the death of another Abusaid in 1499. In the year following, 1500, Ismael Sofi, whose ancestors had formed a separate principality, during the confused state into which this country was thrown under the last of the Tartar princes, conquered Sherwan, Adherbitzan, and other provinces of Persia. In 1510 he took Bagdat and Irak. This prince gave name to the Sophian family, that long reigned in this country, which, of late years, has suffered dreadfully by civil wars. About 996 Mahmud, the son of Sabektekin, a Tartar soldier of fortune, and general to Nuh Eban Mansur, the sixth prince of the Sammanian dynasty, founded an empire at Gazna, in the most eastern parts of Persia, which extended itself over many of the neighbouring countries, and continued till 1222; when Jenghis Khan conquered, and took the capital of it, defeating Jalaloddin the last prince of the Gaznevide family.

Under Nebuchadnezzar this empire grew very famous, being represented by the golden head of the statue in Daniel's prophetic vision; but in 538 Babylon was taken by Cyrus, after which it underwent the revolutions of the Persian empire; but Bagdat, a city built on the Tigris, nearly opposite to Babylon on the Euphrates, remained in some measure subject to the caliphs of the Saracens till 1258, when Hulaku the Tartar took it, and put an end to the caliphat. The Turks took Bagdat in 1534. It was, however, conquered by the Persians under Shah Abbas in 1613, but was finally reduced by the Turks in 1637.",7.01

This empire was overthrown, and Nineveh the capital city taken by Cyaxares king of Media and Nebuchodonosor king of Babylon in 609. Afterwards this country underwent the fate of the Babylonian and Persian empires, the greatest part of it, at least, belonging to the Parthian empire.

It was seized by the Seljuks in 1046, and by Jenghis Khan in 1218. In 1360 Tur Ali Beg the Turkman founded the dynasty called Ak Koyunlu, or the white sheep, in this country. It submitted to Timur Bek in 1400, but he did not retain the conquest. In 1514 it was conquered by Ismael Sofi the Persian, was half conquered by the Turks in 1554, recovered by the Persians in 1613, but completely reduced by the Turks in 1637, when the emperor Morad took Bagdat.",7.03

In 668 they revolted, but in 606 Nebuchadnezzar conquered them, and afterwards they underwent the fate of that empire, till it was conquered by Alexander in 322; presently after which it became a separate kingdom, under the Seleucidae, descended from Seleucus, one of Alexander’s generals; but they were made tributary to the Romans by Pompey in 65 B.C. In 634 the Saracens invaded this country, and they completed the conquest of it in 640. In 970 it was conquered by the Fatimites, immediately after their conquest of Egypt; but the Emirs of Damascus revolted in 1067, and in 1068 those of Aleppo did the same, being called the Atabeks of Damascus and Aleppo. In 1166 Nuroddin, the Atabek of Damascus, gained several advantages over the Egyptians, and his nephew, the famous Saladin, being chosen vizir of Egypt, upon the death of Al Aded, the last of the Fatimite caliphs, assumed the government, and established a new dynasty, the princes of which were called Ajubites. In 1259 this country was conquered by Hulaku the Tartar, but it was presently recovered by the sultans of Egypt. It was ravaged by Timur Bek in 1400, but was not kept by him.

Tyre,Tyre,"This city was built in 1048 B.C. by the Sydonians, who fled from the Edomites when they conquered Sydon, after having been expelled their own country by David. It was taken by Nebuchadnezzar in 572, after a siege of thirteen years. In 538 it came under the power of the Persians. In 332 it was taken, after a siege of six months, by Alexander the Great, and continued subject to the Seleucidae, the Macedonian kings of Syria, till the Romans took possession of it in the year 65B.C. After this it underwent the revolutions of Syria, till 1099, when it was taken by the Franks. In 1123 the sultan of Egypt took it from them, but they soon recovered it, and kept it till 1259, when the Tartars, under Hulaku, took it, together with the rest of Syria; but not keeping it long, it returned to the dominion of Egypt, till it was recovered by the Christians in 1263; but in 1292 it was finally conquered by the sultans of Egypt, with the fate of which it has since been connected.",7.05

The whole nation continued under one head till 975, when upon the death of Solomon, the Ten Tribes separated from those of Judah and Benjamin. The Ten Tribes falling into idolatry, were finally carried into captivity by Senacherib king of Assyria, whereby an end was put to the kingdom of Israel in 721. The Jews, falling into the same courses, were, at length, conquered by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, in 606 (the country possessed by the Ten Tribes having fallen to Babylon upon the conquest of Nineveh in 609).

They continued, however, a distinct people, and sometimes under kings of their own, though, in fact, under the Roman yoke; till, rebelling in 65 after Christ, Titus (who was afterwards emperor of Rome) in the year 70, besieged, and utterly destroyed their capital city Jerusalem. From this time the Jews have been scattered over all the face of the earth. In 636 this country was conquered by the Saracens, and underwent all the revolutions of Syria till 1099, when it was recovered from the Mahometan powers by the Franks, or Christians of this western part of the world; but Jerusalem was retaken by the sultan of Egypt in 1187, and in 1291 the Franks lost every thing they had conquered in this country.

Arabia,Arabia,"This country, according to scripture prophecies, was never yet conquered by any foreign power, though several attempts have been made for that purpose. About the year 622 the Arabians began to distinguish themselves, under the name of Saracens; for Mohammed, at that time, made himself the head of a sect, which, in about 11 or 12 years made themselves masters of all Arabia, and presently after extended their conquests over a great part of the world.
In 891 the sect of Karmatians arose, possessed themselves of all Arabia, and frequently threatened the caliphat, or empire of the Saracens, the seat of which had been removed to Bagdat. This sect retained their power till about 990, after which they dwindled away, some of them joining the Batanists, or Assassins. After this, Ismael, a nephew of Saladin, and who reigned in part of Arabia, assumed the title of Caliph: but his subjects soon rebelled against him, and put him to death. It is said, however, that the prince of a great part of this country is one of his descendants, and therefore of the Ajubian family.",8.01

In the succession of Artaxeas was Tigranes the Great, in 95 B.C. who extended his empire by the reduction of Armenia Minor and other provinces. This prince surrendered to Pompey in 66 B.C. but his family continued upon the throne till Trajan reduced his kingdom to a Roman province in 106. In 370 Sapor king of Parthia conquered this country, but was soon obliged to relinquish it to the Romans; who, however, did not long retain it; for it was under its own princes when the Saracens conquered it about 651. The Seljukian Turks probably conquered it about 1046. After which it underwent a variety of revolutions, till it was conquered by the Prince of Karasm in 1200, who was expelled by Jenghis Khan in 1218. In 1335 the Ilkanian dynasty was founded here by Sheik Hassan Ilkani, and continued till 1385, when Timur conquered it; but this Tartar did not keep it long, for we find the Ilkanian princes sovereigns of it presently after. Upon the death of Ahmed Jalayr, the last of the Ilkanian dynasty, in 1405, Kara Yusef, the head of the Turkmans, took possession of it. This dynasty was called Kara Koyunlu, or of the black sheep; and in 1488 it was conquered by that family which was surnamed the white sheep.

Upon the decline of the Roman empire in the east, this country often became dependent upon the Persians; but it was reduced by the Saracens about 651. In 1046 the Seljukian Turks seized it. It was conquered by the Karasmiads in 1200, and by Jenghis Khan in 1218. The Ilkanian dynasty was founded here about 1335, Timur conquered it in 1381, and Kara Yusef, the head of the Turkmans, from whom it was called Turcomania, possessed it in 1405.

Presently after this Bithynia was governed by kings of its own, with one of whom, named Prussia, Hannibal took refuge after he left Antiochus. Nicomedes IV, the last of this race, left his dominions to the Romans in 40 B.C. Under the Romans it continued till about 1150, when part of it was seized by the princes of the Seljukian dynasty, which began in other parts of Asia Minor, called Rum, in 1087, when Soleiman the son of Kotolmish, nephew of Togrul Beg, began his reign, and ended in 1244 at the death of Gayothoddin Kay Khosrow; for the princes that followed him were tributary to the Roman emperor, and their territories being much divided, they ceased to make any figure.

Lydia,Lydia,"The Lydians were a very antient nation, and were governed by a succession of kings to Croesus, who was famous for his riches and power; but in 544 B.C. he was conquered by Cyrus, who besieged and took him in his capital, Sardis. After this, Lydia underwent the revolutions of the Persian empire, till 283 B.C. when it became part of the kingdom of Pergamos, which commenced under Philaeterus, surnamed the Eunuch, and was seized by the Romans in consequence of the will of Attalus king of Pergamos in 133 B.C. It remained a part of the eastern Roman empire till about 1326, when it was conquered by the Turks.",7.13
Phrygia Minor,Phrygia Minor,"The inhabitants of this country were of great antiquity, and were chiefly famous for the reign of Priam and his ancestors, at Troy, its capital, which was taken by the Greeks in 904 B.C. About 560 it became part of the empire of Croesus king of Lydia, and afterwards underwent the revolutions of that country.",7.14
Germany (northern),Germany,"This country was antiently divided into a great number of independent states, but it was a long time before any of them made themselves considerable. About 390 B.C. some colonies of Gauls, under Segovesus, settled in Germany.

Drusus defeated the Rhaeti, Vindelici, and Norici; in 16 after Christ Germanicus defeated the Angrivarii, Cherusci, and Catti; in 177 Aurelius gained some advantages against the Marcomani; and in 276 Probus made farther conquests; but about the latter end of the third century the Romans lost all their possessions in Germany.

In 432 the Huns, a Tartar nation, dislodged by the Chinese general Tewhyen, in the reign of Hyau-Hoti, emperor of the Han dynasty, conquered a great part of Germany. They seized all the country which extends from the Tanais to the Danube, expelling the Alans, who dwelt on the banks of theTanais, then the Goths, and then the Visigoths, on the Nieper. Attila extended their conquests as far as the Euxine sea. In 771 Charlemaigne conquered several nations of Germany, in 772 he defeated the Saxons, and in 785 he completely reduced and forced them to become christians. In 788 he reduced the duke of Bavaria, and then was master of all Germany.

Upon the death of Lewis the Mild, this country was divided from France, Lotharius being declared emperor of Germany, and Charles the Bald king of France. The Carlovingian race expired in Lewis IV, and Conrad, duke of Franconia and Hesse, who was made emperor in 912, is said to have been the first proper emperor of Germany.

Bohemia,Bohemia,"The dutchy of Bohemia may be traced to the year 598, when Mnatho was duke. The princes of this country had great wars with the Caroline race of kings, but preserved their independency; and in 1199 Przemislas had the title of king, and transmitted it to his successors. In 1383 Sigismund king of Bohemia became emperor of Germany, but in 1440 this country became independent of Germany, being under Ladislaus king of Hungary. In 1536 it was, however, again united to Germany, in the person of the emperor Ferdinand; and it has been in the same hands with the empire ever since, except that in 1617 Frederic elector palatine was chosen king of Bohemia, which occasioned dreadful wars till he was expelled in 1620.",9.05
Hungary,Hungary,"This country, which was chiefly the ancient Pannonia, was reduced by Tiberius in 11 B.C. In 376 the Huns conquered it, and about 460 were expelled by the Gepidae, who submitted to the Lombards in 526. This nation was allowed to settle here by the emperor Justinian; but in 568 they quitted this country, in order to go into Italy, leaving it to the Huns; who remained masters of it till they were conquered by Charlemaigne in 794.
 Afterwards we find the Hungarians an independent nation: for in the year 920, they were governed by Toxis, the father of Geisa, their first christian king. This race continued till 1302, when Charles Martel, son of Charles king of Naples, and of Mary, daughter of Stephen IV, king of Hungary, partly by election, and partly by inheritance and conquest, succeeded to the crown. In 1383 Sigismund, emperor of Germany and king of Bohemia, became king of Hungary in right of his wife; but in 1438 it became again independent of the empire, under Uladislaus. In 1540 Solyman the Turk seized the best part of this country, and Ferdinand the emperor took the rest; from which time it was the seat of frequent and bloody wars between the Germans and the Turks, till 1739, when the latter yielded it up, except Belgrade; and since that time it has generally been annexed to the German empire.",9.06
Crim Tartary,Crim Tartary,"This country was the ancient Bosporus, inhabited by the Tauro Scythae, and the peninsula, which makes a principal part of it, was called Chersonesus Taurica. It was governed by its own kings, one of whom, named Pharnaces, was defeated by Caesar 47 B.C. But this country was never subject to the Romans. In 1266 the Genoese took Kassa in this country from the Tartars, who had not held it long. In 1471 it was taken from them by Mohammed II, who settled in it Mengheli Kerai, who had been one of the Khans of Kipjak, when that country was conquered by the Russians. It is now in a kind of subjection to the Turks.",10.01
Thrace,Thrace,"A considerable part of this country was conquered by Philip and Alexander, kings of Macedon, in the year 356, 348, and 335 B.C. and under their successors it continued, and was enlarged, till the conquest of Macedonia by the Romans in 168 B.C. Constantine the Great removed the seat of the empire to Byzantium in this country, and called it Constantinople; and this whole territory, though frequently invaded, and part of it occupied by the northern Barbarians, continued subject to the Roman still 1204, when the Latins conquered it, in their way to the Holy Land, and kept it till it was recovered by the Greeks in 1261. In 1357 the Turks first penetrated into this part of Europe; in 1360 they took Adrianople, and in 1453 they compleated the reduction of the whole, by taking Constantinople, under Mohammed II, who made it the seat of his own empire.",11.01
Macedonia,Macedonia,"In 596 B.C. Caranus and Perdiccas fled from Phidon and founded the kingdom of Macedon. Under Philip, and his son Alexander, this nation became very considerable, and not only subdued its neighbours, but put an end to the empire of the Persians. Macedonia continued in the family of Alexander the Great, or that of some of his generals, till 168 B.C. when Perseus was conquered by the Romans, and his kingdom reduced into a Roman province. It continued part of the Roman empire till 1392, when the Turks entered it, under Bajazet IV, but they did not complete the conquest of it till 1429, under Amurath II.",11.02
Epirus,Epirus,"This country was first inhabited by the Chaones, and the kingdom of Epirus may be said to have begun with Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, about the year 900 B.C. About 280, another Pyrrhus, king of this country, distinguished himself greatly by his wars with the Romans, in favour of the Tarentines. Upon the death of Deidamia, the last of this race, about the year 240 B.C. the Epirots formed themselves into a republic, which was reduced by Paulus Aemilius the Roman general in 167 B.C. all the towns being destroyed, and the inhabitants enslaved in one day. Upon the taking of Constantinople by the Latins in 1204, Michael Angelus seized this country, and his posterity held it till it was taken by the Turks, under Amurath II, in 1432. In 1447 the famous Scanderbeg revolted from the Turks; but it was finally reduced by Mohammed II, in 1466.",11.03
Thebes,Thebes,"Cadmus, a Phenician, founded this state in 1045 B.C. but Xuthus, the last of this race of kings, being killed in single combat with Melanthus king of Athens, about 820 B.C. the city formed itself into a republic. At the conclusion of the Peloponnesian war, in 404, it was seized by the Lacedaemonians, but was recovered by Pelopidas in 379, from which time it made a great figure in Greece, till the death of Epaminondas in 363. Joining with the Athenians against Philip of Macedon, it was conquered, and forced to take a Macedonian garrison in 338; but revolting, upon the death of Philip, Alexander besieged and took the city in 335, razing it to the ground, and selling the inhabitants for slaves. Reviving again, and joining the Achaean league against the Romans, it was reduced, and by them in 145 B.C. Afterwards it was with the rest of the Greek empire, conquered by the Latins in 1204. It was recovered by the Greeks in 1261, and taken by the Turks about 1458.",11.04
Athens,Athens,"This city was founded by Cecrops in 1080 B.C. In 804 (Codrus, the last king of Athens, being slain in a war with the Spartans) it became a republic, and rose to great power, particularly about the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, at the conclusion of which, in 404, it was taken by the Spartans. In 481 Thrasibulus destroyed the form of government established by the Spartans, and from that time the Athenians enjoyed their liberty, in a great measure, though overawed by the kings of Macedon, till the arrival of the Romans. Sylla the Roman general besieged and took Athens in 87 B.C. the Athenians having joined Mithridates, who was at that time at war with the Romans. Upon the taking of Constantinople by the Latins in 1204, this, and other maritime cities of Greece, were given to the Venetians, who kept many of them after the restoration of the Greek emperors, but it went through the hands of several masters of no note, till 1455, when it was conquered from the Venetians by the Turks; who also retook it, presently after it had been recovered by the Venetians in 1687.",11.05
Achaia,Achaia,"The country of Achaia was peopled by Achaeus the son of Xuthus. In 1080 B.C. Aegialeus, the brother of Phoroneus, and son of Inachus, built Aegialeum, afterwards called Sicyon, which gave a beginning to that kingdom, and was the first town that was built in Greece. There had been an antient league of the cities of this part of Greece, but it made no figure till about 280 B.C. when it became very famous under Aratus, and bravely opposed the kings of Macedon; but Mummius the Roman general put an end to this league by the conquest of this country, and taking the city of Corinth in 146 B.C. Upon the taking of Constantinople by the Latins, in 1204, the maritime cities of this country were allotted to the Venetians; but upon the restoration of the Greeks in 1261, it became part of that empire once more, and continued so till 1458,  when it was reduced by the Turks, under Mahomet II. The Turks were expelled by the Venetians in 1687, but retook it in 1715.",11.06
Sparta,Sparta,"In 1069 B.C. Eurotas, the son of Lelex, and Lacedaemon (who married Sparta, the daughter of Eurotas) reigned in Laconia, and built Sparta. In 708 the famous Lycurgus new model led this state, after which it became very illustrious, particularly by the conquest of Athens. Philopaemen having defeated Machanidas and Nabis, their tyrants, joined the Spartans to the Achaean league in 192 B.C. Afterwards they quarrelled with the Achaeans, and joined the Romans against them; but not withstanding this, it may be said, that they, and the rest of Peloponnesus, were reduced by the Romans, at the taking of Corinth in 146 B.C. and in 71 they, together with the rest of Greece, were by Vespasian reduced into the form of a Roman province. In the latter times of the Greek emperors, this territory was subject to despots, who owed allegiance to the emperors. The last of them was Thomas Paelaeologus, who was dispossessed by Mahomet II, in 1458. The Venetians conquered it betwixt 1685 and 1687, but the Turks recovered it in 1715.",11.07
Messenia,Messenia,"This country was conquered by the Spartans in 632 B.C. It revolted in 607, and was reduced again in 588; when many of the inhabitants quitted their country, and founded Messana in Sicily. They were restored to their former free state by Epaminondas in 369, were comprehended in the Achaean league about 280, but revolted in 191; and routing the Achaeans in 183, they put to death the famous Philopaemen. The city, however, was taken by the Achaeans immediately after, and from that time underwent the revolutions of the Achaeans and of Sparta.",11.08
Crete,Crete,"The Idaei Dactyli and Curetes were the antient inhabitants of this country. In 1015 B.C. Minos reigned in Crete. Afterwards there were a variety of republics in this island; but in 68 B.C. the whole of it became subject to the Roman empire. The Saracens conquered it in 812, but the Greeks recovered it in 954. When Constantinople was taken by the Latins in 1204, this island fell to the Venetians, but in 1645 the Turks took it from them, except the capital, which surrendered in 1669.",11.09
Rhodes,Rhodes,"This island is said to have been first peopled by the Telchines from Crete. They were driven out by the Dorians, who were governed by kings at the time of the Trojan war in 904 B.C. but about 480 they formed themselves into a republic. The city of Rhodes was built in the time of the Peloponnesian war in 432 B.C. It was seized by Artemesia queen of Caria in 351 B.C. but was restored to its liberty soon after, by the help of the Athenians. In 331 the Rhodians surrendered to Alexander the Great, but upon his death, in 324, they expelled the Macedonian garrison, and became a free people again. In 303 this city was famous for its siege by Demetrius Poliorcetes, whom they baffled. In 156 they were admitted into an alliance with Rome, from which may be dated their subjection to the Roman empire; and in the civil wars which followed the death of Caesar, Cassius took the city, and plundered it in 42 B.C. and in 71 it was reduced by Vespasian into the form of a Roman province. The Saracens conquered this island in 652; but the Greeks recovered it in the civil wars of the Saracens (perhaps about the year 900.) In 1124 it was taken by the Venetians, but was recovered by the Greeks, under John Ducas, about 1227. The Turks conquered it in 1283, and though it was taken from them by the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, in 1310, it was re-taken by Soliman II, in 1522, after a most desperate siege. ",11.1
Syracuse,Sicily,"The antient inhabitants of this island were the Sicani, and were divided into a number of small principalities. In 719 B.C. Archias, the son of Euergetes, of the stock of Hercules, led a colony of Greeks from Corinth, and built Syracuse. In 503 the Carthaginians, landing under the command of Machaeus, conquered part of Sicily; but after having subdued almost the whole of it, they were compelled, by the Romans, to abandon their conquest at the conclusion of the first Punic war, in 241 B.C. and Syracuse was taken by storm in 200 B.C. by which the whole island came into the possession of the Romans. In 439 and 440 the Vandals conquered it, but they were dispossessed by Bellisarius in 535. In 669 it was conquered by the Saracens, but the Greeks soon recovered part of it, which they held till 1041, when both the Saracens and Greeks were expelled by the Normans, under William Ferebatus. Roger I, who succeeded this William, was by the Pope made king of Sicily. He conquered Puglia, butin 1199 the emperor Henry reduced both Puglia and Sicily. In 1263 the count of Anjou was made king of Sicily by the Pope, Manfred, the natural son of the emperor, being defeated and slain; but in 1282 the Sicilians massacred the French by the order of Peter III, king of Arragon, who had married the daughter of Manfred; and in 1442, Alphonsus of Arragon, then king of Sicily, conquered Naples.",12.01

Tarentum,Naples,"The greatest part of this country was anciently possessed by the Etruscans, who built Nola and Capua; but the Greeks arriving, and founding colonies in it, the Etruscans became confined within the boundaries of Hetruria, beyond the Tiber. In 333 B.C. the Campanians, who inhabited part of this territory, submitted to the Romans; in 291 the Samnites, who possessed another part of it, were finally subdued; and in 272 Tarentum (which was founded by Phalantus the Spartan in 625 B.C.) was conquered, and all this part of Italy became part of the Roman empire, whose revolutions it underwent, till the arrival of the Lombards in 568, who seized part of it. At the same time also several principalities arose in this division of Italy, which did not acknowledge the Greek emperor, particularly the dutchy of Benevento, which then comprehended a considerable part of it; but this, together with Lombardy, submitted to Charlemaigne in 774, the Greek emperors only keeping possession of some of the maritime places in this country. In 840 the Saracens entered this part of Italy, but were finally expelled by the Greeks about 1002. About 1043 the Normans conquered a great part of Puglia in this country, and put an end to the Greek empire in it; and in 1053 Henry IV. granted Benevento to the pope, in exchange for Bamber. In 1127 Roger, count of Sicily, took possession of Puglia, and soon after assumed the title of king. In 1194 the emperor Henry reduced Puglia and Sicily. In 1442 Alphonsus of Arragon, being then king of Sicily, conquered Naples, and from this time the two kingdoms have always gone together. In 1713 the two Sicilies, as they are now called, submitted to the Imperialists, and have continued in the family of Spain to this day, but not annexed to the Spanish monarchy.",13.01

Latium,Latium and Rome,"This territory, together with the rest of Italy, was, probably, in the possession of the Hetruscans, till the arrival of Evander in 964B.C. who built a small town in Latium, called Palantium. About the time of the Trojan war, in 904 B.C. Latinus reigned in this part of Italy, and from him it is that Latium is said to have derived its name. In his reign Aeneas landed in Italy, married his daughter Lavinia, and built Lavinium; his son Ascanius built Alba Longa, and about 627 B.C. Romulus, who was descended from the kings of Alba, built Rome. Latium was finally conquered by the Romans in 338 B.C. and underwent all the revolutions of Rome. This city, after many revolutions of government, and many civil and foreign wars, had, at the time of the birth of Christ, extended its empire over the greatest part of the known world; but the Roman power declined greatly in the western part of the world, upon the removal of the seat of empire to Constantinople. Alaric, king of the Goths, took and plundered Rome in 410; Genseric the Vandal did the same in 455, as did Ricimer (descended from the royal family of the Suevi, though in the service of the Roman emperor) in 472. Lastly, Odoacer, king of the Herali (chosen a leader of the Barbarian soldiers, who revolted on account of their pay) put an end to the Roman empire in the west, in the reign of the emperor Augustulus, and caused himself to be proclaimed king of Italy in 476; but in 493 he was defeated, and put to death by Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths. In 537 Belisarius, the general of Justinian, recovered Rome, and the greatest part of Italy from the Goths; but in 547 the Goths, under Totila, again took Rome, and though they were soon after driven out by Belisarius, they retook it upon his return to Constantinople. At length, in 553, Narses the Roman general conquered and flew Teia the last king of the Goths in Italy, after which it was governed by officers called exarchs, who resided at Ravenna.  In 726 Rome, in the pontificate of GregoryII. revolted from the Greek emperors, and with its dutchy, including part of Tuscany, and part of Campania, because a free state, and was governed by a senate. In 800 the senate and people of Rome acknowledged Charlemaigne as emperor of the west; and he surrendered the city and dutchy of Rome to the pope, reserving the sovereignty to himself as emperor of the Romans. Under the popes, as temporal princes, Rome and its territory remain to this day. The Lombards, under Alboinus, took possession of a great part of Italy in 568. In 752, under Aistulsus, they expelled Eutychius the eunuch, and so put an end to the exarchate; but in 774, Charlemaigne king of France dispossessed them of all their dominion in Italy, obliging their last king Desiderius to go into a monastery. The Franks were acknowledged sovereigns of Italy till about the year 961, when the German emperors became superior in this country.",13.03
Rome,Latium and Rome,"This territory, together with the rest of Italy, was, probably, in the possession of the Hetruscans, till the arrival of Evander in 964B.C. who built a small town in Latium, called Palantium. About the time of the Trojan war, in 904 B.C. Latinus reigned in this part of Italy, and from him it is that Latium is said to have derived its name. In his reign Aeneas landed in Italy, married his daughter Lavinia, and built Lavinium; his son Ascanius built Alba Longa, and about 627 B.C. Romulus, who was descended from the kings of Alba, built Rome. Latium was finally conquered by the Romans in 338 B.C. and underwent all the revolutions of Rome. This city, after many revolutions of government, and many civil and foreign wars, had, at the time of the birth of Christ, extended its empire over the greatest part of the known world; but the Roman power declined greatly in the western part of the world, upon the removal of the seat of empire to Constantinople. Alaric, king of the Goths, took and plundered Rome in 410; Genseric the Vandal did the same in 455, as did Ricimer (descended from the royal family of the Suevi, though in the service of the Roman emperor) in 472. Lastly, Odoacer, king of the Herali (chosen a leader of the Barbarian soldiers, who revolted on account of their pay) put an end to the Roman empire in the west, in the reign of the emperor Augustulus, and caused himself to be proclaimed king of Italy in 476; but in 493 he was defeated, and put to death by Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths.

The Franks were acknowledged sovereigns of Italy till about the year 961, when the German emperors became superior in this country.",13.04
Sabinum,The Country of the Sabines,"These people were, probably, a branch of the Umbri. They had frequent wars with the Romans in the infancy of the Roman state, but were finally subdued, and became part of the Roman empire in 290 B.C. Afterwards they underwent the revolutions of Rome, till they were conquered by the Lombards in 568; but in 755, Pepin of France obliged the Lombards to surrender the greatest part of this country, which was then called Pentapolis, and now the March of Ancona, or more concisely La Marca, to the pope.",13.05
Umbria,Umbria,"The Umbri originally possessed the greatest part of Italy. The Pelasgi expelled them from a great part of their possessions, and the Etruscans expelled the Pelasgi. The Umbri retired beyond the Apennines to a country which was long after called by their name. In 356 B.C. the Gauls seized part of this country, and held it till they were dispossessed by the Romans in 221 B.C. The rest of Umbria had been part of the Roman empire from the year 297 B C. This country afterwards underwent the revolutions of Rome, and constituted a principal part of the exarchate, of which Ravenna, a city in this district, was the metropolis; but in 752 an end was put to the exarchate by the Lombards, under Aistulphus, who expelled the eunuch Eutychius the last exarch. In 774 Charlemaigne gave this territory to the popes, when he had put an end to the empire of the Lombards.",13.06
Florence,Florence,"This country, after having been inhabited by the Umbrians, and after them by the Pelasgi, received a colony of Tryhenians, who are said to have come from Lydia, under the conduct of one Tryhenus. This people soon extended their conquests beyond the Appenines, and over the greatest part of Italy, and became famous for the arts of peace as well as of war. Afterwards they were confined in their boundaries by various other nations. In 396 B.C. Veii, an important city in this country, was taken by Camillus, the famous Roman general: and in 281 all Hetruria was entirely subdued by the Romans. It underwent the revolutions of that empire and of Lombardy, till, being cruelly used by Frederic II. the inhabitants, upon his death, in 1250, asserted their independency, and after a great variety of wars, and internal revolutions, this territory was ceded to the duke of Lorrain in 1737, when it had been seized by the French.",13.07
Venice,Venice,"The Veneti, the ancient inhabitants of this country, are supposed to have been descended from the Heneti, a people who came from Asia Minor, under Antenor, after the Trojan war, in 904 B.C. The Gauls, who took possession of the country about 356, were conquered by Marcellus, who killed their king Viridomarus with his own hands, when he dedicated the second spolia opima to Jupiter Feretrius in 221 B.C. Afterwards it underwent the revolutions of Rome and Lombardy; except that the islands, on which the city of Venice is built, began to be inhabited about the year 421, by a people who fled from the frequent invasions of the Goths and other northern nations, when they ravaged Italy, and may be said to have been independent on the emperors of Constantinople, till the year 803; when, upon a peace that was made between Charlemaign, declared emperor of the west, and Nicephorus emperor of the east, the Venetians were not comprehended under the jurisdiction of either of them, but were acknowledged the common friends of both. In 1084 Dalmatia was annexed to the Venetian dominions; and in 1405 the Venetians took Verona, Padua, and other places on the continent of Italy. But before this time they had greatly distinguished themselves in their wars with the Turks, from whom they took Candia and many other places; and though they have less power than formerly, they still remain an independent and respectable republic.",13.08
Genoa and Corsica,Genoa,"This territory was anciently inhabited by the Ligures, who submitted to the Romans in 115 B.C. and underwent the revolutions of Rome and Lombardy till 950, when the Genoese formed themselves into a republic; which, after many wars with the Pisans, Venetians, and Moors, continues to this day.",13.09
Milan,Milan,"The capital of this territory is said to have been built by the Gauls in 357 B.C. and, together with the rest of Gallia Transpadana, submitted to the Romans in 222 B.C. Afterwards it underwent the revolutions of Rome and Lombardy, till 1221, when it formed itself into a republic, and, under the sovereignty of the German emperors, was governed by its own dukes, from John Galeazzo in 1395, till 1501, when it was conquered by Lewis XII. king of France. In 1513 the emperor Maximilian recovered it from the French, and Francis I. both won and lost it again in 1521. Upon the death of Francis Sforza, in 1535, it was, by Charles V. united to the crown of Spain, under which it continued till 1706, when the French and Spaniards were driven out of it by the Imperialists, upon whom it is now dependent as a fief.",13.1
Savoy,Savoy,"This territory was anciently part of Gallia Narbonensis, which submitted to the Roman arms in the consulship of Q. Martius Rex, in 118 B.C. In 395 the Alemans seized it, but were expelled by the Franks in 496, and, it underwent the same revolutions with Switzerland, til about 1040, when Conrad, emperor of Germany, gave in property St. Maurice, Valais, and the country of Chablais, to Hubert, surnamed with the white hands. His descendents soon enlarged their territories by marriages and conquests. In 1713 the duke of Savoy took the title of king of Sicily, and had possession of that island till 1718, when he exchanged it for Sardinia, at the treaty called the quadruple alliance. The king ’s residence is at Turin in Piedmont.",13.11
Switzerland,Switzerland,"JULIUS CAESAR defeated the Helvetii, the old inhabitants of this country, in 57 B.C. After remaining under the dominion of the Romans, it was in 395 seized by the Alemans, a German nation, who made their first appearance in 214, and settled in the dutchy of Wirtemberg. It was held by them till they were expelled by Clovis, king of France, in 496. Under the Franks it remained till 888; when, upon the death of Charles the Gross, it was seized by Raoul, and became part of the kingdom of Burgundy, which was given by Rodolf, the last king of Burgundy, to Conrad II. emperor of Germany, in 1032; from which time it was esteemed a part of the empire; but being unjustly treated by Albert duke of Austria, the inhabitants revolted in 1308. In 1315 the several states of which this country is composed made their league perpetual, and in 1649 their liberty was absolutely fixed by treaty.",14.01
Holland,Holland,"This country was anciently part of the territories of the Belgae, who submitted to Julius Caesar about 47 B.C. It was possessed by the Franks about 412, and continued under them, till Thierry, general of Charles the Bald, established a sovereignty there, and became the first count of Holland in 868. His posterity enjoyed it till 1206, when it passed to the earls of Hainault, in which family it continued till 1417, when it passed, by the surrender of Jaqueline count of Hainault and Holland, to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. In 1534 the people this province, rather than submit to the bishop of Utrecht, surrendered their liberties to Charles V. who, in 1556, gave them to his son Philip of Spain. Being oppressed by the Spaniards, they, together with other neighbouring provinces, revolted in 1572, and at length compelled their old masters to acknowledge them an independent republic, as they continue to be to this day.",15.01
Flanders,Holland,"This country was part of the territories of the ancient Belgae, who were conquered by Julius Caesar about 47 B.C. The Franks seized it about 412, and in 864 it was granted to Baldwin I. by the title of earl of Flanders, the sovereignty being reserved to France. This earldom, by the marriage of Philip, duke of Burgundy, with Margaret, daughter of Lewis de Malatin, earl of Flanders, in 1369, came to the house of Burgundy, and it passed to the house of Austria by the marriage of Mary, daughter and heiress of Charles the Hardy, to Maximilian emperor of Germany. In this family it still is, but the sovereignty was in France till 1525, when Charles V. taking Francis I. prisoner, at the battle of Pavia, was released from that servitude. In 1556 Charles resigned these territories to his son Philip king of Spain. In ???? Denmark was ceded to the French by the English, who had possessed it from the year 1?5?. Afterwards the French made more conquests in Flanders, which were confirmed to them at the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in the year ???8, and they have rather been enlarged than diminished since that time. In ???5 at the treaty of Vienna, the Spanish dominions in the Netherlands were confirmed to Germany, as had been stipulated in the treaty of London in 1722.",15.02
Lorrain,Lorrain,"This country was given by the emperor Lotharius, about the year 851, to his second son Lotharius, from whom it had its name, and who resided at Metz. Lorrain continued under princes of its own till the year 1670, when it was finally seized by Lewis XIV. king of France.",15.03
Burgundy,Franche Comté,"This territory was conquered by Julius Caesar about 47 B.C. About 842 this province, which was part of the dutchy of Burgundy Transjuran, came to be, in a manner, independent of the Franks. The whole dutchy comprehended the provinces of Dauphiné and Provence (which were called Burgundy Cisjuran) as well as these countries. Upon the death of Charles the Gross, in 888, they were erected into a kingdom, and continued to be independent till about 1025, when Rodolph, the last king of Burgundy, gave them to Conrad II, emperor of Germany. In 1101 they were given to Otho of Flanders, son to a sister of the emperor Conrad, and by the family of Burgundy they came, in 1477, together with other territories, to the house of Austria, in which this province remained, but under its own prince, till 1674, when it was seized by the French.",15.04
France (northern),France,"The ancient inhabitants of this country were called Gauls, and received a colony of Belgae from Germany about 200 B.C. That part of the country which was called Gallia Narbonensis, was a made a Roman province in 118 B.C. about which time the Allobroges were reduced. In 57 B.C. Caesar defeated the Helvetii; and in 47 the Belgae, together with the rest of the country, were conquered by him, except the Salassi, a people who inhabited a part of the Alps, and who were not reduced till about 25 B.C. In 400 the emperor Honorius allowed the Goths to settle in the southern parts of Gaul. In 406 the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi broke into this country; and after remaining there three years, passed into Spain, which they divided among them. In 413 the Burgundi, a people of Germany, seized upon that part of Gaul which is in the neighbourhood of the Rhine; in 490 they enlarged their territories; but in 534 an end was put to their kingdom by the Franks, another German nation, who had settled between the Rhine and the Maine in 412. In 470 the Franks, under Childeric(?), extended their conquests in Gaul, and in 498 they put an end to the dominion of the Romans in this country. In 510 the Franks made themselves masters of the greatest part of the dominions of the Goths, Clovis having defeated and killed their king Alaric, whereby they came into possession of almost the whole of what is now called France. In 886(?) the Normans ravaged part of France, in 887 they laid siege to Paris, in 906 they settled in Neustria, and the next year seized Britany, Picardy, and Champaign. In 1204 Philip Augustus king of France took Normandy from king John of England; but in 1154 Henry II. of England, by virtue of his marriage with Eleanor, heiress of the house Poictiers (after Lewis the young king of France had divorced her) became possessed of Poictou, Guienne, and Santoigne; besides being earl of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine, on the death of his father Geoffroy Plantagenet. In 1347 Edward I. took Calais, and peopled it with English. In 1360 a peace was made between Edward III. and the king of France, by which Guienne, Poictou, Santoigne, and several other territories in the neighbourhood of Calais, were granted to Edward in full sovereignty, and he relinquished all claim to Normandy.  About the year 1372, the French recovered all that the English possessed in France, except Calais; but in 1415 Henry V. invaded France, gained the great battle of Agincourt, and died in possession of Normandy, Paris, and a great part of the kingdom; and Henry VI. his son, was crowned king of France in Paris by the earl of Bedford. Till the end of the year 424 the English had great success, reducing Maine, and other provinces in that neighbourhood; but from that time the English affairs went backwards, so that all Normandy was lost in 1450, Guienne in 1453, and nothing was kept but Calais and Guisnes. In 1477, the duke of Burgundy being killed in a battle with the Swiss, Lewis XI. annexed a part of that dutchy to the throne of France, at the same time that the rest of his estates were seized by the Germans, in consequence of the daughter of the last duke having married the emperor Maximilian. In 1498 Lewis XII. married the Dutchess Dowager of Bretaigne, where-by he annexed that dutchy to his dominions.

In 1360 a peace was made between Edward III. and the king of France, by which Guienne, Poictou, Santoigne, and several other territories in the neighbourhood of Calais, were granted to Edward in full sovereignty, and he relinquished all claim to Normandy.  About the year 1372, the French recovered all that the English possessed in France, except Calais; but in 1415 Henry V. invaded France, gained the great battle of Agincourt, and died in possession of Normandy, Paris, and a great part of the kingdom; and Henry VI. his son, was crowned king of France in Paris by the earl of Bedford. Till the end of the year 424 the English had great success, reducing Maine, and other provinces in that neighbourhood; but from that time the English affairs went backwards, so that all Normandy was lost in 1450, Guienne in 1453, and nothing was kept but Calais and Guisnes. In 1477, the duke of Burgundy being killed in a battle with the Swiss, Lewis XI. annexed a part of that dutchy to the throne of France, at the same time that the rest of his estates were seized by the Germans, in consequence of the daughter of the last duke having married the emperor Maximilian. In 1498 Lewis XII. married the Dutchess Dowager of Bretaigne, where-by he annexed that dutchy to his dominions. This province had been a separate principality, at least, from the year 846, when Nomenon was its duke. In 1558 the French conquered Calais, Guisnes, and all that the English held in France.",15.09
Dauphine,Dauphine and Provence,"These provinces were anciently part of Gallia Narbonensis, and underwent all the revolutions of Savoy, which was also a part of it, till 842, when it was part of the Duchy of Burgundy, which was, in a manner, independent of any other power. In 876 Hugh de Arles obtained these provinces of Boson duke of Burgundy, with the title of Earl of Provence. Under these earls it continued, with several changes of family, till 1481; when Charles, earl of Maine, gave it to Lewis XII. king of France, who was his cousin-german. At what time Dauphiné came to be separate from Provence is not certain, but its last prince Humbartus II. gave it to Philip de Valois king of France in 1346, upon condition that the eldest son of the king of France should always bear the title of Dauphin, which has been observed ever since.

Navarre,Spain ,"This country was, in early times, divided into a great number of petty states. Before the time of Cyrus (perhaps about 530 B.C.) the Carthaginians had settled themselves in the southern parts of Spain, where they built Gades, now called Cadiz. After the first Punic War in 235, the Carthaginians continued their conquests under Asdrubal, and under Hannibal in 209; but the Romans dispossessed them of all that they held in this country about 206. In 144 Numantia surrendered, and in 16 B.C. Cantabria was finally reduced by Agrippa; upon which the Romans were masters of the whole country. Athaulsus, the son of Alaric, was the first Goth who settled in Spain, being driven from Gaul by other northern nations in 415. In 404(?) the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi settled in this country, the Romans still maintaining their ground in Tarracco, and its neighbourhood. In 428 the Vandals quitted Spain, and went into Africa, the Suevi taking possession of most of their provinces, and the Romans of the rest. In 585 the Suevi were expelled by the Goths, here called Visigoths, and in 568 the Romans were finally expelled by them.
From this time the Goths held possession of all Spain, till the reign of Rothric in 711, when the  Saracens from Africa invaded Spain, under the command of Muza, and in ten months overran the whole country. About 1025 the Saracens in Spain were divided into separate kingdoms; in 1091 they were conquered by the Almoravides from Africa; and in 1140 the Almoravides were conquered by the Almohedes. In 1219 this empire of the Saracens was subdivided again; for as several governors of provinces revolted from Zeit Arax, the son and successor of Mohammed, in Africa, those in Spain followed their example, and accordingly Aben-hut, who was descended from the kings of Saragossa, possessed himself of the kingdom of Murcia, and the best part of Andalusia; Mohammed Ben Abdalla seized Boeza, and the country round it; and the kingdom of Valentia was all that remained to Abuzeit the brother of Mohammed Enazor.
In 718 Don Pelayo began to recover part of Spain from the Saracens. He reigned in Biscay and the Asturies. In 984 Don Bermudo II. of this race, was acknowledged king of Oviedo and Leon, upon a victory he gained over the Moors; but in 1037 this kingdom fell to that of Castile, its prince having invaded that country, and being killed in battle. (The counts of Castile had revolted from the kings of Oviedo about 922, and soon after became kings.) In 1080 the Moorish kingdom of Toledo was conquered, and that city became the capital of the kingdom of Castile. In 1234 these princes took Cordoua from the Moors; in 1248 they took Seville, and in 1266 they took Murcia. After many wars and mutual conquests, this kingdom of Castile, was finally united to that of Arragon by the marriage of Isabella queen of Castile to Don Ferdinand king of Arragon in 1479. In 1491 Ferdinand reduced Granada; and in 1511 he conquered Navarre, whereby an end was put to the dominion of the Moors in Spain. In 716 the kingdom of Navarre commenced, in the person of Garcia Ximines, and was greatly enlarged by conquest, till it afterwards comprehended Arragon.
In 1035 Arragon was erected into a kingdom by Sancho the Great, king of Navarre, in favour of his son Ramiro. In 1076 his son succeeded to the kingdom of Navarre; but in 1133, after a great defeat, and the death of the king, the kingdoms of Arragon and Navarre separated, and chose different kings.

In 984 Don Bermudo II. of this race, was acknowledged king of Oviedo and Leon, upon a victory he gained over the Moors; but in 1037 this kingdom fell to that of Castile, its prince having invaded that country, and being killed in battle. (The counts of Castile had revolted from the kings of Oviedo about 922, and soon after became kings.) In 1080 the Moorish kingdom of Toledo was conquered, and that city became the capital of the kingdom of Castile. In 1234 these princes took Cordoua from the Moors; in 1248 they took Seville, and in 1266 they took Murcia. After many wars and mutual conquests, this kingdom of Castile, was finally united to that of Arragon by the marriage of Isabella queen of Castile to Don Ferdinand king of Arragon in 1479. In 1491 Ferdinand reduced Granada; and in 1511 he conquered Navarre, whereby an end was put to the dominion of the Moors in Spain. In 716 the kingdom of Navarre commenced, in the person of Garcia Ximines, and was greatly enlarged by conquest, till it afterwards comprehended Arragon.
In 1035 Arragon was erected into a kingdom by Sancho the Great, king of Navarre, in favour of his son Ramiro. In 1076 his son succeeded to the kingdom of Navarre; but in 1133, after a great defeat, and the death of the king, the kingdoms of Arragon and Navarre separated, and chose different kings. In 1240 the kings of Arragon conquered Valentia from the Moors.",16.08
Castile,Spain,"This country was, in early times, divided into a great number of petty states. Before the time of Cyrus (perhaps about 530 B.C.) the Carthaginians had settled themselves in the southern parts of Spain, where they built Gades, now called Cadiz. After the first Punic War in 235, the Carthaginians continued their conquests under Asdrubal, and under Hannibal in 209; but the Romans dispossessed them of all that they held in this country about 206. In 144 Numantia surrendered, and in 16 B.C. Cantabria was finally reduced by Agrippa; upon which the Romans were masters of the whole country. Athaulsus, the son of Alaric, was the first Goth who settled in Spain, being driven from Gaul by other northern nations in 415. In 404(?) the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi settled in this country, the Romans still maintaining their ground in Tarracco, and its neighbourhood. In 428 the Vandals quitted Spain, and went into Africa, the Suevi taking possession of most of their provinces, and the Romans of the rest. In 585 the Suevi were expelled by the Goths, here called Visigoths, and in 568 the Romans were finally expelled by them.
From this time the Goths held possession of all Spain, till the reign of Rothric in 711, when the  Saracens from Africa invaded Spain, under the command of Muza, and in ten months overran the whole country. About 1025 the Saracens in Spain were divided into separate kingdoms; in 1091 they were conquered by the Almoravides from Africa; and in 1140 the Almoravides were conquered by the Almohedes.

Portugal,Portugal,"The ancient inhabitants of this country were called Lusitani. They submitted to the Romans about 200 B.C. The Alans settled here about 409. In 457 they were expelled by the Suevi; and in 585 the Suevi were expelled by the Goths. About 714 the Saracens conquered it; but it began to be recovered from them in 1080 by count Henry, to whom Alonzo king of Leon, had given his daughter in marriage, and some territories bordering upon Portugal, together with all that he could conquer from the Moors, as the Saracens were then called, from their coming into Spain from Mauretania. His son Alonzo assumed the title of king, conquered Lisbon in 1146, and recovered almost all Portugal from the Moors. Upon the death of Henry king of Portugal in 1580, Philip II. of Spain seized upon this country; but in 1640 the duke of Braganza recovered it from the Spaniards, and was crowned king by the name of John IV. Portugal has been independent of Spain ever since. ",17.01
Wales,England,"The British isles were inhabited originally by a people called Britons, of the same stock with the ancient Gauls,  ie Celtic. The first conquest that was made of this part of the island was by the Romans. It was began in the year 43, under the emperor Claudius, and was completed in 78 under Domitian. Julius Caesar had invaded this island in the year 54 and 53 B.C. but he made no conquest, his forces being repulsed by the natives. In 410 the Romans, being no longer able to defend so distant a province, relinquished it to the old inhabitants, who, calling in the Saxons from Germany to assist them to repel the invasion of the Scots and Picts, were all conquered by them, except those who retired into Wales.
The Saxons, arriving at different times, formed seven different kingdoms, which, having some kind of union among themselves, are all together called the Heptarchy. Of these Kent was the first. It commenced in 455 under Hengist, and out of it, in 527, was formed the kingdom of Essex by Erchenwin. Both these kingdoms were conquered by Egbert king of  Wessex in 825. In 491 the kingdom of Sussex was formed by Ella, but from the year 760 it was so reduced, that it was considered as a province to Wessex. This kingdom was formed under Cerdic in 519, and Egbert, one of its princes, completed the conquest of the whole heptarchy about 827. The kingdom of Northumberland began under Ida in 547. It was sometime divided into two separate kingdoms, and was the last that was conquered by Egbert. The kingdom of East Anglia was formed by Uffa in 571, and in 792 it was conquered by Mercia. This last kingdom was founded by Crida in 585, and about 825 it was conquered by Egbert.
About the year 866 the Danes under their king Ivar, invited by earl Bruern Bocard, made a descent upon England, and conquered Northumberland.

It commenced in 455 under Hengist, and out of it, in 527, was formed the kingdom of Essex by Erchenwin. Both these kingdoms were conquered by Egbert king of  Wessex in 825. In 491 the kingdom of Sussex was formed by Ella, but from the year 760 it was so reduced, that it was considered as a province to Wessex. This kingdom was formed under Cerdic in 519, and Egbert, one of its princes, completed the conquest of the whole heptarchy about 827. The kingdom of Northumberland began under Ida in 547. It was sometime divided into two separate kingdoms, and was the last that was conquered by Egbert. The kingdom of East Anglia was formed by Uffa in 571, and in 792 it was conquered by Mercia. This last kingdom was founded by Crida in 585, and about 825 it was conquered by Egbert.
About the year 866 the Danes under their king Ivar, invited by earl Bruern Bocard, made a descent upon England, and conquered Northumberland. Presently after they conquered East Anglia, and in 873 they were masters of Mercia. About 877 they were in possession of the whole kingdom, king Alfred being obliged to hide himself from their pursuit; but soon after, this prince entirely defeated them, and forced them either to abandon the island, or submit to his government. Those who chose the latter settled in East Anglia. They generally revolted at the beginning of every reign, and about 1003 Swein king of Denmark conquered all the northern parts of England, and king Ethelred retiring into Normandy, the whole kingdom submitted. Upon his death the Danes proclaimed his son Canute king; but the English, having recalled Ethelred, the island was, as it were, divided between them, till 1017, when Canute became master of all England. Under Edward the Confessor, in 1041, the Saxon line was restored without bloodshed; but the Normans under William the Conqueror subdued the kingdom in 1066, and the descendents of this prince have been in possession of the crown of England ever since. In 1283 Wales was subdued by Edward I. Lewellyn their last king being defeated and slain.",18.08
Scotland (southern and central),Scotland,"This part of the island of Great Britain was anciently called Caledonia, and the inhabitants Caledones, who were of Celtic original, and probably those tribes of the Britons, who had wandered the farthest northwards. In the fourth century we find them distinguished into Scots and Picts. In 85, Agricola the Roman general subdued the whole of this part of the island; but did not retain more of the conquest than that part which is south of the Forth and Clyde. In 121 Adrian relinquished more, building a wall from the Solway Frith to the river Tyne. In 144 the Romans extended their boundaries again as far as the wall of Agricola; but Severus, though he conquered the whole country in 208, thought proper to adhere to the boundary of Adrian.
Upon the Romans quitting this island in 410, the Scots regained the possession of all that is now called Scotland, and made excursions very far southwards, though without retaining their conquests. About 839 the Picts are said to have been entirely reduced by Kenith II. the first sole king of all Scotland. In 1296 Edward I. king of England, conquered all this country, and the English were not finally expelled till the year 1314. In 1602 James VI. king of Scotland, succeeded to the crown of England, on the death of queen Elizabeth, and in 1707 the union between the two crowns was completed.",18.09

Ireland,Ireland,"The original inhabitants of this island were probably Britons. In 795 the Danes siezed a part of it, and were never completely subdued till the English took possession of the whole: till that period, also, it was generally divided into a number of petty sovereignties, a circumstance of which the English took advantage in the conquest of the island. The first settlements of the English in this country were made in 1169 by private adventurers, but under the sanction of Henry II. who arrived there himself in 1172, and completed the conquest.

In 1314 the Scots promoted a rebellion in Ireland, and in 1315 Edward Bruce, king of Scotland, expelled the English out of almost all the places they held in it, and was proclaimed king of Ireland; but the Scots were expelled again in 1318. From the very first reduction of the island there were constant rebellions of the natives, so that the English were seldom masters of the whole country, nor was their possession of it entire and peaceable till 1614. The Irish catholics revolted again in 1641, and committed the famous massacre of the protestants; but they were reduced by Cromwell in 1653.",18.12
